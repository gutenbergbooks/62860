<p>Nick Carter stands for an interesting detective story. The fact
that the books in this line are so uniformly good is entirely due to
the work of a specialist. The man who wrote these stories produced
no other type of fiction. His mind was concentrated upon the creation
of new plots and situations in which his hero emerged triumphantly
from all sorts of troubles and landed the criminal just where
he should be&mdash;behind the bars.</p>

<p>The author of these stories knew more about writing detective stories
than any other single person.</p>

<p>Following is a list of the best Nick Carter stories. They have been
selected with extreme care, and we unhesitatingly recommend each of
them as being fully as interesting as any detective story between cloth
covers which sells at ten times the price.</p>

<p>If you do not know Nick Carter, buy a copy of any of the New
Magnet Library books, and get acquainted. He will surprise and delight
you.</p>

</div>


<p>Nobody had heard the report of a pistol.</p>

<p>There had been no disturbance; in fact, no audible
altercation, no startling cry for help, or even a groan
of sudden, terrible distress.</p>

<p>The man lay there as motionless, nevertheless, as if
felled by a thunderbolt. His life had been snuffed
out like the flame of a candle by the fury of a whirlwind.
Death had come upon him like a bolt from the
blue. By slow degrees his face underwent a change&mdash;but
it was not the change that ordinarily follows sudden
death, that peaceful calm that marks the end of
earthly toil and trouble.</p>

<p>Instead, the smoothly shaven skin seemed to shrink
and wither slightly over the dead nerves and lifeless
muscles, and a singular slaty hue that was hardly perceptible
settled around his lips and nostrils, partly dispelling
the first deathly pallor. It was as if the blast
from a furnace, or the searing touch of a fiery hand,
had withered and parched it.</p>

<p>He was a comparatively young man, not over thirty,
and he was fashionably clad in a plaid business suit.
He was lying flat on his back on the floor of the second-story
corridor of a building known as the Waldmere
Chambers, in the city of Madison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p>Presently the door of one of the several adjoining
rooms was opened and a stylish young woman
emerged. She was clad for the street, and lingered to
lock the door and put the key in her leather hand
bag. Then she turned, and her gaze fell upon the prostrate
man, several yards away and nearer the broad
stairway leading down to the lower floor and the
street door.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! Is he drunk?” she gasped, shrinking
involuntarily.</p>

<p>She feared to approach him, though her hesitation
was only momentary. For she heard the tread of
some one on the stairs, obviously that of a man, and
she ventured nearer just as the other appeared at the
top of the stairs, a well-built, florid man of middle
age.</p>

<p>“Oh, Doctor Perry, look here!” she cried excitedly.
“What’s the matter with this man? Is he drunk
or ill, or what is the&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, well, I don’t wonder you ask.” Doctor
Perry approached and gazed down at him. “I don’t
know, Miss Vernon. He appears to be&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped short; then crouched and raised the
man’s arm, dropping it quickly. It fell back upon the
floor as if made of clay.</p>

<p>“Heavens!” he exclaimed, rising hurriedly. “The
man is dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead!” Miss Vernon echoed, turning pale.</p>

<p>“Stone dead. Do you know him?”</p>

<p>“No. I just came from my rooms to go to lunch
and saw him lying here.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear him fall, or any disturbance, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I heard nothing, Doctor Perry, not a sound.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[7]</span></p>

<p>“We must call a policeman. I will wait here while
you do so. Go down to the street and find an officer.”</p>

<p>“Won’t it be better to telephone? I can do so in
a moment.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, in that case,” Doctor Perry nodded.
“Hasten.”</p>

<p>Miss Vernon ran back and entered her rooms, on
the door of which a modest brass plate stated that her
business was that of a manicure and ladies’ hairdresser.
She ran to a telephone in one of the attractively
furnished rooms, crying quickly to the exchange
operator:</p>

<p>“Give me the police headquarters. Hurry, please!
It’s an emergency case.”</p>

<p>Seated with Chief Gleason in the latter’s private
office when the telephone call was received in the outer
office was the celebrated American detective, Nicholas
Carter, who had arrived in Madison early that morning
with two of his assistants, and who then was
discussing with the chief the business which had occasioned
his visit, the nature of which will presently
appear. They were interrupted by a police sergeant,
who knocked and entered, saying quickly:</p>

<p>“A man has dropped dead, chief, in a corridor of the
Waldmere Chambers. Shall I send the ambulance?”</p>

<p>“What man? Is he known?” Gleason questioned,
swinging around in his swivel chair.</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Who informed you?”</p>

<p>“A woman telephoned that the body had just been
found. Doctor Perry, the dentist, was watching it
while she telephoned. His office is in the Waldmere
Chambers. Neither of them knew the dead man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, send the ambulance,” Chief Gleason directed.
“You had better go, also, and look into the case.
If&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“One moment,” Nick Carter interrupted. “I think
I’ll go with him, chief, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“What need of that? It is merely a case of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We don’t know what kind of a case it is, Gleason,
at present,” Carter cut in again. “A sudden death
always warrants more or less suspicion. It is barely
possible that this has some connection with the series
of mysterious crimes that we have been discussing,
and which has finally led you to call on me for assistance.
Be that as it may&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hang it, Carter, I’ll go with you myself, then,”
Gleason interrupted, rising and taking his cap. “You
may be right, of course, and the chance is worth taking.
You remain here, sergeant, but send along the
ambulance. We’ll take a taxi.”</p>

<p>Chief Gleason started for the street while speaking,
closely followed by the famous detective, and
they were so fortunate as to find a taxicab just passing
the headquarters building.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that Nicholas Carter arrived
upon the scene of the sudden fatality scarcely ten
minutes after it was discovered. He was not without
an intuitive feeling, moreover, that he was to
be confronted with a mystery of more than ordinary
depth and obscurity, a case that would tax not
only his rare detective genius, but also his skill, craft,
and cunning in every department of his professional
work.</p>

<p>“I think, Gleason, that you had better not mention<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
my name while we are looking into this matter,” he
remarked, as they were alighting from the taxicab.</p>

<p>“Very well,” Gleason readily assented. “But what
do you expect to gain by suppressing it?”</p>

<p>“Just what is hard to say at this stage of the
game,” Carter replied. “If all you have told me is
true, however, and Madison is afflicted with a crook
whose crafty work has completely baffled your entire
police department, it may be of some advantage
to me, at least, if he does not immediately learn that
I have been employed to run him down. That would
serve only to put him on his guard.”</p>

<p>“I see the point,” Gleason nodded. “I agree with
you, too.”</p>

<p>“The fact has not been disclosed, I understand.”</p>

<p>“Only to a few members of the force, Carter;
all of whom were ordered to say nothing about it.
They may be trusted.”</p>

<p>“Very good! If there should be occasion to introduce
me to others, then, present me as Mr. Blaisdell,”
Carter directed. “That is the name under which
I am registered at the Wilton House.”</p>

<p>“Blaisdell&mdash;I’ll bear it in mind.”</p>

<p>“Come on, then,” the detective added. “We are
none too soon. A crowd is beginning to gather.”</p>

<p>Their remarks had been made while they were entering
the building. A group of men had collected
at the top of the stairs. They were restrained by a
policeman who had been called in from the street,
and a passageway was hurriedly made for Chief Gleason
and his companion. That the latter was the
famous New York detective, not even the policeman
then suspected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>

<p>The scene in the second-floor corridor was about
what Nick Carter anticipated. Half a score of men
and women had come from the adjoining rooms and
offices and were gazing with mingled awe and consternation
at the lifeless man on the floor. He was
lying where he had fallen. A physician had been
hurriedly summoned and was bending over him, engaged
in making a superficial examination.</p>

<p>Chief Gleason started slightly when he beheld the
upturned face of the dead man.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” he muttered. “It’s Gaston Todd.”</p>

<p>Carter heard his muttered exclamation. Restraining
him, at the same time furtively watching the
physician, he said quietly:</p>

<p>“One moment, chief. Who is Gaston Todd? What
about him?”</p>

<p>“He was born and brought up here,” Gleason replied.
“He had been in the stock brokerage business
for ten years, cashier for Daly &amp; Page. He
was a clubman and a figure in society.”</p>

<p>“Married?”</p>

<p>“No. He had a suite in the Wilton House. By
Jove, it’s barely possible that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What is barely possible?”</p>

<p>“That you are right.”</p>

<p>“Right in what respect? Tell me.”</p>

<p>Carter had noticed the chief’s hesitation, his dark
frown, as if he had started to say something which
discretion quickly led him to withhold. He demurred
only for a moment, however, then explained
with lowered voice:</p>

<p>“Right, perhaps in thinking there is knavery back
of this. There had been a feeling of bitter rivalry<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
between Todd and a young local lawyer, Frank Paulding,
who is an exceedingly impetuous and hot-headed
chap. They had an ugly altercation in the Country
Club last night, I have heard, and it is said that they
nearly came to blows. That may have ended it, of
course, though this sudden death of Todd, following
it so quickly&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is somewhat significant,” Nick Carter put in
quietly. “I agree with you. In what have the two
men been rivals?”</p>

<p>“For the hand of Edna Thurlow, by far the most
beautiful and accomplished girl in Madison. She inherited
half a million when her father died. Her
mother, Mrs. Mortimer Thurlow, is also very wealthy
and fashionable. She’s the acknowledged leader of
the local smart set. The two men may have met
here this morning. Possibly the fight of last night
was resumed, resulting in&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Let it go at that,” the detective interrupted. “The
physician has ended his examination.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">NICK CARTER’S OPINION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Chief Gleason immediately turned and approached
the rising physician, asking a bit brusquely:</p>

<p>“Well, Doctor Doyle, what do you make of it?
The man is dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, there is no question about that, Mr.
Gleason.”</p>

<p>“What was the cause?”</p>

<p>“It appears to be a case of heart disease.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of it?”</p>

<p>“One cannot be absolutely sure, Mr. Gleason, without
performing an autopsy,” Doctor Doyle said
blandly, while he wiped his fingers with his handkerchief.
“I feel reasonably sure. There is no wound
that I can discover, nor does there appear to be any
indication of foul play. Yes, I feel reasonably sure
of it,” he repeated.</p>

<p>“You don’t think, then, that there is any occasion
to notify the coroner?” Gleason said inquiringly.</p>

<p>“There seems to be none. I have no doubt that
the man died from natural causes. There is no superficial
evidence to the contrary, or any&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Doctor Doyle broke off abruptly, his gaze having
fallen upon the detective, who had passed back of
the couple and approached the body.</p>

<p>Carter then was bending over it, and with his finger
had raised one of Todd’s eyelids. He studied
the ball and pupil for several seconds, then took a<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
powerful lens from his pocket and inspected the dead
man’s face and lips. He looked up after a moment
and said:</p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you, doctor. This man appears
to have been a very strong and rugged fellow.”</p>

<p>“That is true, sir, as far as it goes,” Doctor Doyle
admitted, frowning slightly when his professional
opinion was thus questioned by a stranger.</p>

<p>“It seems hardly probable that such a man died of
heart disease,” the detective said pointedly. “Nor
do his eyes denote that apoplexy was the cause.”</p>

<p>“You will have to go deeper, sir, nevertheless, to
find positive evidence of the cause,” Doctor Doyle
said, rather coldly. “Superficial evidence is not absolutely
convincing.”</p>

<p>“Have you noticed this slight discoloration of the
skin near the mouth and nostrils?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p>“How do you account for that?”</p>

<p>“Such slight changes immediately after death are
not uncommon,” said the physician. “There may
be a slight settlement of blood in the tissues in that
locality.”</p>

<p>“You would not attribute it to a blow?”</p>

<p>“Surely not. There could be no mistaking the
evidence of a violent blow.”</p>

<p>“But the skin appears to be slightly withered,”
said Carter. “Minute wrinkles are discernible with
my lens, particularly in the thin skin of the lips.”</p>

<p>“That may be easily explained.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“Death may have been preceded by a sudden terrible<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
pain, causing a contraction of the lips, and what
may be termed a pinched condition of the nerves and
muscles in that locality. They may not have relaxed
yet, which causes the drawn appearance of the skin
which, you say, is discernible with your lens. No,
I do not wish to examine it more closely. I don’t
think it signifies anything.”</p>

<p>“I do,” said the detective, rising abruptly. “I
think&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“One moment, gentlemen.” The interruption came
from Doctor Perry, the dentist, who still was among
the people then gathered in the corridor. “Here is
Professor Graff, the chemist. His opinion ought to
be valuable in a case of this kind.”</p>

<p>Nicholas Carter turned to gaze at the man who
then was approaching.</p>

<p>Professor Graff had come from a room at the rear
end of the corridor, and he appeared surprised that
something unusual had occurred, evidently having
heard none of the disturbance. He was a man of
medium build, somewhat bowed, and appeared to be
about sixty years old. His hair and beard were gray,
his complexion sallow, his expression serious and
reserved. He wore gold-bowed spectacles and looked
as if he might be of German or Swedish extraction.
He was clad for the street, wearing a soft felt hat
and a coat with a cape, a style augmenting his foreign
appearance.</p>

<p>“Dear me, what has happened?” he said gravely,
while others made way for him to approach. “A
gentleman injured&mdash;not dead, is he?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Doctor Perry drew him nearer. “He was
found lying here a few minutes ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[15]</span></p>

<p>“I heard nothing. I have just come up from my
laboratory. Why, why, this is Mr. Gaston Todd,”
Professor Graff added amazedly, manifestly shocked
by the discovery. “I cannot be mistaken. I have
seen him frequently in the Wilton House.”</p>

<p>“There is no question as to his identity,” replied
the dentist, who appeared to be the only person acquainted
with the chemist. “There is a difference
of opinion between Doctor Doyle and this gentleman,
however, as to the possible cause of his death.
They&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Let me explain,” the detective interposed, addressing
the chemist. “It will take me only a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, certainly,” Professor Graff bowed, regarding
the detective a bit curiously.</p>

<p>Carter turned again to the body, briefly pointing
out the conditions he already had mentioned, and
then added earnestly:</p>

<p>“Use my lens. You can see more distinctly.”</p>

<p>Professor Graff smiled faintly and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Really, sir, there is no occasion,” he replied. “My
opinion in such a matter is worthless. I know nothing
about such things. I am a chemist, not a physician.
I can subject the physical organs to analysis
and detect poisons, or other foreign substances, perhaps;
but I would not wish to pass upon the conditions
you have mentioned. It seems only reasonable
to me, however, that Doctor Doyle’s opinion ought
to be entirely reliable.”</p>

<p>“I think he will find it so,” said the latter, as
Professor Graff moved away and descended the stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>Nick Carter did not longer argue the point. Instead,
turning to Chief Gleason, he whispered quietly:</p>

<p>“You had better be governed by my opinion, nevertheless,
and take the necessary steps to insure an
autopsy.”</p>

<p>“You really think, then, that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind what I really think. I’ll see you
later and inform you. You will make no mistake,
however, in doing what I direct. Take it from me,
Gleason, this man was&mdash;murdered.”</p>

<p>“Murdered? Why do you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush!” Nick quietly cautioned. “There will be
nothing in immediately disclosing my suspicion. It
will be better to conceal it temporarily. Has this
man a family?”</p>

<p>“No; no family.”</p>

<p>“Or relatives who will be likely to interfere?”</p>

<p>“I think not. I am quite sure of it, in fact.”</p>

<p>“Very good. Notify the coroner, then, and have
him take the necessary steps to perform an autopsy
later,” the detective directed. “Understand?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” Chief Gleason nodded. “I will see
to it.”</p>

<p>“And I will see you later, also the coroner, and
explain my position,” Carter added. “Just now I
have something else in view and must get a move on.
Mum’s the word, mind you, until after the autopsy.”</p>

<p>He did not wait for an answer. He turned away
and quickly departed, leaving his observers wondering
who he was and what he had said, his instructions
having been imparted in subdued and hurried
whispers.</p>

<p>Returning to the street, Carter consulted a directory<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
in a drug store, and five minutes later he entered
the Gratton Building and approached the office
of the lawyer whom the chief had mentioned. He
listened at the door for a moment, hearing nothing,
and then opened it and entered.</p>

<p>A tall, clean-cut man of thirty swung around in
his swivel chair from a rolltop desk. He was of
light complexion, with a smoothly shaved, attractive
face, and frank blue eyes. He was alone and looked
a bit curiously at his visitor, who, glancing sharply
around the well-equipped office, appeared somewhat
surprised, and said:</p>

<p>“Pardon me. Are you Mr. Paulding?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am, sir.”</p>

<p>“I thought I saw Mr. Gaston Todd come in here
a moment ago. Was I mistaken?”</p>

<p>“Humph!” Paulding straightened up with an expressive
grunt. “Yes, sir, very much mistaken. Todd
never comes here, nor would it be wise for him to
do so. I would fire him out, head, neck, and heels,
before he could open his mouth. You may repeat
that to him, if you like and are a friend of his. I
would say the same to Todd himself.”</p>

<p>Nick laughed, thrusting his hands into his pockets,
and surveyed with quizzical eye the somewhat impulsive
speaker.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m no friend of Todd,” he replied. “I know
him only by sight. There is a little matter, however,
about which I would like to question him.”</p>

<p>“All right, in that case, and I’ll do all I can to
help you,” Paulding said more agreeably. “I saw
him in the Waldmere Chambers about fifteen minutes<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
ago. He still is there, perhaps, if you care to
seek him.”</p>

<p>“In the rooms of one of the tenants, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No. He was in the second-floor corridor,” Paulding
interrupted. “He appeared to be waiting for
some one. I passed him when I came out.”</p>

<p>“Did you speak to him?”</p>

<p>“Not by a long chalk. I speak to Todd only under
protest and when it cannot be avoided. That’s
all I can tell you. You may find him there, perhaps.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter had accomplished his object. He was
a keen physiognomist and could read faces and characters
much less frank and outspoken than those of
this lawyer. He now was absolutely sure, in fact,
that Paulding knew nothing about Todd’s death, nor
had even heard of it. He smiled and replied:</p>

<p>“Much obliged. Sorry to have troubled you.”</p>

<p>“No trouble at all, sir.”</p>

<p>“May I ask, Mr. Paulding, what took you to the
Waldmere Chambers?”</p>

<p>“I went there to confer with a client who&mdash;&mdash;”
Paulding broke off abruptly, gazing more sharply
at the detective, then frowningly added: “But why
do you ask why I went there? What is it to you?
It strikes me that you are deucedly inquisitive.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” said Nick, coolly placing a
chair near that of the lawyer and sitting down. “There
is serious occasion for it, Mr. Paulding, as I now will
explain: I happen to know that Mr. Gaston Todd
has not left that second-floor corridor in the Waldmere
Chambers. He was found dead there immediately
after you left the building.”</p>

<p>“Dead&mdash;found dead!” Paulding stared amazedly.<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
“What are you saying? Do you really mean it&mdash;that
Gaston Todd is&mdash;dead!”</p>

<p>If Nick had had even a lingering shadow of suspicion,
it would have been instantly dispelled by the
expression of the lawyer’s face. It was one that
no man could have feigned, however accomplished
an actor. He bowed and replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Paulding, that is precisely what I mean.
Gaston Todd is dead.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, I can hardly believe it. It seems utterly
incredible. Found dead, you say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Where you last saw him. He was&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop a moment! What do you imply by that?”</p>

<p>Paulding’s face had changed like a flash. His brows
fell and his eyes took on a threatening gleam and
glitter. He lurched forward in his chair, adding
quickly:</p>

<p>“Why did you say he was found immediately after
I left the building, and where I last saw him? What
are you insinuating? What are you trying to put
over on me? Why, if you knew he was dead, did
you come here to pretend you were seeking him? Who
the devil are you, that you impose upon me in this
way, implying that I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Here is my card,” the detective blandly interposed,
tendering it. “You may, perhaps, know me by name.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">A FRIEND WORTH HAVING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Nick Carter smiled amusedly when Frank Paulding,
having fairly snatched the card and read it,
straightened up in his chair and stared at him with
almost ludicrous astonishment.</p>

<p>“Nicholas Carter!” he exclaimed; “the New York
detective! Good gracious!”</p>

<p>“Is it so very amazing?” the detective asked dryly.</p>

<p>“Yes, by Jove, it is,” said Paulding, pulling himself
together. “I do, indeed, know you by name, and
who does not? Let the circumstances be what they
may, too, I am very glad to become acquainted with
you. I am not blind, nevertheless, to the fact that
your visit is rather significant; decidedly so, in reality,
in view of your duplicity and covert insinuations
that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That you know something about Todd’s sudden
death,” Nick put in, checking him. “Don’t let that
annoy you. I did so, Mr. Paulding, only to assure
myself to the contrary. I have succeeded, too, completely.”</p>

<p>“But what was the occasion?” Paulding questioned.
“I don’t see, Mr. Carter, why you thought I knew
anything about it.”</p>

<p>“I did not really think so,” Nick said dryly. “I foresaw,
however, what others possibly will think, sooner
or later, and I wanted to look at you and take your
measure before circumstances might make it difficult<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
for me to do so with absolute certainty. He
is a wise man and keen, you know, who anticipates
coming events.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, I fail to get you, Mr. Carter,” Paulding
said more seriously. “Take my measure, eh? What
others will possibly think? Say, you don’t&mdash;you don’t
mean that&mdash;that Gaston Todd was killed, do you?
Not that he was&mdash;murdered?”</p>

<p>Nick glanced at the door, to be sure that he had
closed it. He then replied more impressively:</p>

<p>“I am a stranger to you, Mr. Paulding, but you
will make no mistake in meeting me halfway and taking
my advice. I frequently am a good friend to
have in time of trouble.”</p>

<p>“I know of none I would rather have,” Paulding
said quickly.</p>

<p>“That goes, does it?”</p>

<p>“You bet it goes.”</p>

<p>“What now passes between us, then, must be strictly
confidential,” said the detective. “You must, moreover,
be governed by my instructions. You will presently
see, I think, that that will be the only wise
course for you to shape. If you are not inclined to
meet me in this way&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But I am,” Paulding cut in earnestly. “I’m not
blind. I now see there is something wrong, Mr.
Carter, and that you are here in my behalf. I would
be more than a fool, sir, if I did not take advantage
of your offer. I promise in advance to do what you
direct.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” Nick said approvingly. “You will
not regret it.”</p>

<p>“But how am I in wrong?” Paulding asked anxiously.<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
“Has a crime been committed? Was Todd
murdered?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” said the detective.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! Is it possible that I am suspected
of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“One moment, Paulding, and I will tell you about
it.”</p>

<p>He then stated the circumstances briefly, in so far
as he had figured in the case, and then added pointedly:</p>

<p>“You now can see why I wanted to talk with
you, Paulding, and get your measure.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I see,” Paulding nodded. “But how
did you know that I passed Todd in the corridor just
before he died, or was killed? I saw no one else.
I am sure, too, that no one saw me. How did you
know I had just left there?”</p>

<p>“For two reasons,” Nick replied. “One, because
you told me so.”</p>

<p>“I told you so?” Paulding stared perplexedly.</p>

<p>“In effect,” smiled the detective. “You said you
had passed Todd about fifteen minutes ago, and I
knew that was just about when his body was discovered.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see. You are a keen reasoner, Mr. Carter.
You said there were two reasons, however.”</p>

<p>“The other can be briefly stated: Todd did not
look to me like a man who had dropped dead of any
organic trouble. He looked like a strong and healthful
fellow. I very soon suspected murder; and, after
having been told of your fight with Todd in the
Country Club last night, I reasoned that you had just
met him, perhaps, and been seen by some person
who, for some reason and knowing all of the circumstances,<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
had taken advantage of them to craftily
kill Todd and fix the crime upon you, assuming that
you had not done it. That’s why I lost no time in
sizing you up from personal observation. I wanted
to do so before you heard of Todd’s death, in case
you were innocent, of which I was quickly convinced.
Have I made it plain to you?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly plain, Mr. Carter,” Paulding said earnestly.
“I am more than grateful. I don’t know
how I can repay you for your interest in me, a stranger&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of that,” the detective interrupted.
“I am interested in serving justice, mind you, and am
taking what seems to be the best way. I am not
absolutely sure that Todd was murdered. An autopsy
will determine that. If he was, at such a time
and in such a public place, without any disturbance or
any superficial wound, it was accomplished by most
extraordinary means and by a knave of exceeding
boldness and ability, who may be equally as skillful
in hiding his identity and covering his tracks. That’s
why I have tackled the case in the bud, so to speak,
in anticipation of what may follow.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said Paulding. “It now is perfectly
plain.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get right down to business, then, for I wish
you to answer a few questions,” Carter replied.</p>

<p>“As many as you wish, Mr. Carter, and to the
best of my ability.”</p>

<p>“Very good. Todd appeared to be waiting for
some one, you have said.”</p>

<p>“Yes. That was my impression.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[24]</span></p>

<p>“Do you know for whom, or how long he had
been there?”</p>

<p>“No, neither.”</p>

<p>“Do you know of any person whom he visits, who
has rooms or an office in that building?”</p>

<p>“I do not. He was not the type of man I fancied,
Mr. Carter, and we never have been good
friends.”</p>

<p>“I was told that he was a popular clubman.”</p>

<p>“He was, I admit, and there are many who liked
him.”</p>

<p>“What was the trouble between you last evening?”
the detective inquired. “I was told&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I can tell you in a nutshell,” Paulding interrupted.
“He spoke of a young lady in terms that no gentleman
should have used. I called him down, Mr. Carter.
One word led to another, and we nearly came
to blows. That’s all there was to it, however, for
others interposed and Todd immediately left the clubhouse.
I did not see him again until we met this
morning in the Waldmere Chambers.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything against him, so far as
his character and habits are concerned?”</p>

<p>“Well, no,” said Paulding, after a moment. “He
was somewhat dissipated at times and in with the
fast set. He gambled more or less on the quiet, and
I know he was friendly with other women while
paying attention to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To Miss Thurlow,” put in Carter, when the lawyer
hesitated. “Her name was mentioned to me, also,
and the fact that a bitter rivalry existed between you
and Todd.”</p>

<p>“Well, there is some truth in that,” Paulding admitted,<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
flushing. “Regardless of my affection and
whether she really cares for me, Mr. Carter, I never
considered Todd a fit man for Edna Thurlow. I
would not have permitted him to visit a sister of mine,
if I had one. Edna is young, however; only nineteen,
and it’s not difficult for a man of Todd’s type
to deceive an inexperienced girl. I do not mean by
that, Mr. Carter, that he would not have cared to
marry her. He was out to get her, if possible,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“So are you, Paulding, aren’t you?” Nick interrupted.
“Tell me frankly.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, I am, Mr. Carter, if she’ll have me.”</p>

<p>“Do you think she will?”</p>

<p>“I hope so, think so, in fact, though I have not
yet ventured to ask her. Bear in mind, Mr. Carter,
that she is wealthy, prominent socially, and a very
beautiful and accomplished girl, while I am only a
struggling lawyer, bucking up against a hard game,
and with only patronage and income enough to keep
me going. But I’ll make good, all right, and then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I think you will, Paulding,” the detective again
interposed. “Let it go at that, now, for my time
is limited. I wish to give you a few instructions,
which you must follow to the letter.”</p>

<p>“I will do so,” Paulding assured him. “You may
rely upon that.”</p>

<p>“Much may depend upon it,” Carter said impressively.
“As I have said, nevertheless, I am not absolutely
sure that Todd was murdered. Nor, if he
was, am I sure that you will be seriously involved,
or even suspected. I think you may be, however,<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
for the reason stated, and you must in that case do
precisely what I direct.”</p>

<p>“I certainly will, Mr. Carter,” Mr. Paulding again
said earnestly.</p>

<p>“To begin with, then, say nothing about this interview,
or the fact that we have met and that I
am interested in the case,” Nick directed. “Do not
confide in any one, not excepting Miss Thurlow,
even, in case you are arrested and charged with the
crime.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! Do you anticipate that?” Paulding
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“It is possible, if not probable,” the detective replied.
“You must, in that case, do precisely as if
we had not met. Say not a word about me until I
countermand these instructions. My presence in Madison
is not generally known, and, while looking into
this matter, as well as other business that brought me
here, I may derive an advantage from concealing the
fact.”</p>

<p>“I understand, and will act accordingly.”</p>

<p>“You may assert your innocence, employ another
lawyer, get bail if you can, and all that&mdash;but not a
word about me.”</p>

<p>“That goes,” Paulding nodded. “I’ll be as dumb
as an oyster.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” said Carter, extending his hand and
rising to go. “I will make it a point to see you as
soon as possible, in case you are arrested, but do not
under any circumstances send for me. On the other
hand, do not fear that I will desert you. I shall know
all that is going on and will be hard at work for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>

<p>“That’s good enough for me,” declared Paulding,
warmly pressing the detective’s hand. “You can bank
on me, Mr. Carter, let come what may&mdash;as I’m going
to bank on you.”</p>

<p>“Good enough, then,” the detective added. “We’ll
wait and see how the cat jumps.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE MAN OF LAST RESORT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Nicholas Carter did not return to the Waldmere
Chambers after his interview with Frank Paulding.
It was not entirely due to his intuitive perception, or
to any evidence definitely involving another, that had
caused him to feel that Paulding had played no part
in the killing of Gaston Todd, and that he might
be possibly the victim of a carefully planned conspiracy.</p>

<p>It was due in part to what Chief Gleason had told
him earlier that morning, when they were discussing
the business that had brought him secretly to
Madison with his two most reliable assistants.</p>

<p>Nick saw nothing to be gained by returning to
the Waldmere Chambers, and he hastened to the Wilton
House, instead, going at once to the suite assigned
him, where Chick and Patsy then were waiting for
him.</p>

<p>“Well, there must be something doing, indeed,”
Chick exclaimed, gazing at him when he entered.
“Has it taken Gleason the entire morning to tell you
why we are needed in Madison?”</p>

<p>“No, not quite,” Carter replied, taking a chair.
“There is more doing than what Gleason confided
to me, Chick, and I think there may be some connection
between them. Unless I am very much mistaken,
there was a deucedly singular murder committed
about an hour ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[29]</span></p>

<p>“The devil you say!” Chick returned. “Have you
been looking into it?”</p>

<p>“Superficially.”</p>

<p>“Tell us, chief,” said Patsy, with immediate interest.
“Why singular?”</p>

<p>“I will do so presently,” Nick replied. “I first will
tell you why Chief Gleason sent for me. It’s a rather
remarkable story.”</p>

<p>“A mysterious crime, chief?”</p>

<p>“Quite a number of them, Patsy.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! We are booked for some hard work,
then, if the local police cannot handle them.”</p>

<p>“Crimes of what kind, chief?” Chick inquired.</p>

<p>“The first was committed several months ago,” said
Carter, disposing of the match with which he had
been lighting a cigar. “It was the robbery of a prominent
local banker, named Wagner, whose statements
are entirely reliable.”</p>

<p>“What were the circumstances?”</p>

<p>“Briefly stated, he was going home from his club
about nine o’clock one evening, after having dined
there with a friend. He is a well-built, powerful man
of forty, about the last whom a holdup man would
venture to tackle. He wore some valuable jewelry,
however, and he had nearly a thousand dollars in his
pocket, which he wanted to use before banking hours
the following morning.”</p>

<p>“The crook may have known about it.”</p>

<p>“Possibly, though Wagner doesn’t think so.”</p>

<p>“Where was the crime committed?”</p>

<p>“In the grounds of his own house, a fine residence
in Garside Avenue. He was sauntering up a gravel
walk leading to his front door, when a man came<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
down from the veranda and approached to meet him.
Wagner did not recognize him, but he naturally inferred
that the stranger had called to see him, and,
not finding him at home, that he was about departing.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” Chick nodded. “That was perfectly
natural.”</p>

<p>“What followed was quite the contrary,” Carter
remarked dryly. “The stranger stopped directly in
front of him and asked whether he was Mr. Wagner.
He had an unlighted cigar in his mouth, or so Wagner
has stated. The latter replied in the affirmative,
of course, and asked what was wanted.”</p>

<p>“And then, chief?” queried Patsy.</p>

<p>“Then came the one singular feature of the case,”
said the detective. “Wagner felt a sensation as if
a breath of air had hit his face. He doesn’t know
where it came from, nor can he explain it, for the
stranger still had the cigar between his lips and his
mouth was closed. Be that as it may, Wagner instantly
felt very numb and confused, and in another
moment he lost consciousness.”</p>

<p>“Fainted away?”</p>

<p>“Not quite that, Patsy.”</p>

<p>“Great guns! What was he up against, chief?”</p>

<p>“That’s the question,” said Nick. “He was seen
on the gravel walk a little later by a passing policeman,
who hastened to aid him. Wagner still was
unconscious, dead to the world, as he afterward expressed
it when revived by a physician. He had been
robbed of his money and all of his jewelry, and the
thief had disappeared, leaving absolutely no clew
to his identity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>

<p>“He has not been traced, nor any of the jewelry?”</p>

<p>“Neither.”</p>

<p>“Is any one suspected?”</p>

<p>“No.” Nick shook his head. “There have been
numerous other robberies of a like character, and
under similar circumstances, but in no case has any
of the stolen property been recovered, nor a clew
to the criminal been found. The police have been
at work for months on more than a score of such
cases.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! that’s very peculiar,” Chick said thoughtfully.
“Is the description of the crook the same in
all cases?”</p>

<p>“Far from it,” Carter replied. “They vary materially.”</p>

<p>“There must be a gang at work, then.”</p>

<p>“It appears so.”</p>

<p>“Did the victim in each case experience the same
sensations as those described by Wagner?”</p>

<p>“Very similar, though the circumstances were not
always the same. All agree, however, that they suddenly
became unconscious from an unknown cause,
while talking with a person who had accosted them
on one pretense or another. One stock broker was
robbed in that way while alone in his business office.
The police are all at sea, and the community is on
nettles as to who will be the next victim of the mysterious
and elusive plunderers. That’s why Gleason
sent secretly for me to aid him.”</p>

<p>“How do you size it up, chief?” Patsy inquired.
“What do you make of it?”</p>

<p>“Well, take the case of Wagner,” Carter replied.
“He is very much mystified by the breath of air he<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
felt on his face. His assailant’s lips were closed
around a cigar, and Wagner is sure he could not have
exhaled the breath he suddenly felt.”</p>

<p>“Surely not, chief, in that case,” said Patsy.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so sure of it,” Carter returned. “When
a man confronts another and has a full-length cigar
between his teeth, the outer end of it may be very
near the other’s face.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, chief, but what of it?”</p>

<p>“Suppose it was not a cigar, but made to closely
resemble one?”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! I get you,” cried Patsy. “You mean
a tube through which one’s breath might be blown.”</p>

<p>“I mean a tube, Patsy, which contained something
that may have been forced outward by the man’s
breath, and so directed that Wagner must have inhaled
it,” Carter explained.</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“Just what it was, being powerful enough to immediately
overcome him, and how the tube was constructed
so that the user would not be affected by
its contents when ejecting it, are open questions.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think that is how it was done?”
Chick inquired, a bit incredulous.</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” nodded the detective.</p>

<p>“Had Gleason thought of that device, or any of the
police?”</p>

<p>“No, nor did I inform him,” said Carter, smiling
significantly. “Since we are about to investigate these
mysterious cases, which I have decided to do, we may
derive an advantage by not disclosing our suspicions.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” Chick agreed. “That’s good judgment.
It may be, chief, that the crook has discovered<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
an odorless and very powerful narcotic gas; also various
methods by which he can craftily and quickly
administer it.”</p>

<p>“Something of that nature, Chick, which also indicates
that he is a man of education, with a knowledge
of drugs and mechanics,” Carter pointed out.
“All this is what leads me to think there may be some
connection between these numerous strange robberies
and the mysterious killing of Gaston Todd this noon,
if an autopsy shows positively that he was murdered.”</p>

<p>“That’s the case you mentioned?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I now will tell you about it.”</p>

<p>The detective proceeded to do so, covering all of
the essential points, both during his observations in
the Waldmere Chambers and his call upon Frank
Paulding.</p>

<p>“By Jove! this case does have a striking likeness
to the others,” Chick declared, after listening attentively.
“It may be a murder case, as you suspect.”</p>

<p>“The similarity first led me to suspect it.”</p>

<p>“Naturally.”</p>

<p>“There are three other cases, too, about which Gleason
told me, that are fully as peculiar,” Carter added,
knocking the ashes from his cigar.</p>

<p>“What are they, chief?” questioned Patsy.</p>

<p>“They involve three girls, or, more properly, young
women, for all are about twenty,” said the detective.
“All were found unconscious in the grounds of the
local hospital.”</p>

<p>“At the same time?”</p>

<p>“No. There was an interval of several days between
them.”</p>

<p>“Found when?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>“About midnight.”</p>

<p>“Had they been robbed?”</p>

<p>“No. There was no robbery in either case, nor
has it been learned that an outrage of any kind was
attempted,” Nick explained. “Each of the girls was
first taken to the police headquarters, I understand,
and afterward sent to the hospital, where one of the
physicians soon succeeded in reviving her. She then
was allowed to depart, after stating that she could
not account for her strange condition, nor remember
anything that had befallen her.”</p>

<p>“By gracious, that is peculiar, chief, for fair,” declared
Patsy, gazing perplexedly.</p>

<p>“More strange, perhaps, and somewhat significant,
is the fact that not one of these girls could afterward
be found by the police, when they tumbled to
a possibility that the three cases might have some relation
to the many mysterious robberies.”</p>

<p>“Their names are not known?”</p>

<p>“So Gleason states. It appears that they were not
learned by the hospital authorities.”</p>

<p>“The whole business does seem strange, indeed,”
Chick said more gravely. “It looks as if we were
up against a very curious and complicated mess.”</p>

<p>“And crooks of extraordinary craft and cunning,”
put in Patsy earnestly.</p>

<p>“I agree with both of you,” said Nick, glancing
at his watch. “Come, we are due for a late lunch. I
will make further inquiries this afternoon, and then&mdash;well,
I will have decided by evening how we can
begin our work. The autopsy to-morrow may show
us the way.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">ANOTHER STRANGE CASE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The steeple bell of a church within a stone’s throw
of Hamilton Square struck twelve. The successive
strokes fell with monotonous reverberations on the
midnight air, breaking with solemn resonance the
quietude of that reputable residential section of Madison.</p>

<p>For Hamilton Square, though not far from the
business district, was in an attractive part of the city,
to which the extensive tract of land had been donated
years before, in part for a public square and the remainder
for the site, park, and gardens of the now
locally famous Osgood Hospital, established by the
donor, and still largely supported by the income from
his bequests.</p>

<p>The last stroke of the bell scarce had died away
to a customary stillness, when a burly policeman, one
James Donovan, appeared on one side of the square
flanking the hospital grounds, moving along near
the iron fence and pausing now and then to gaze
across the broad avenue at the opposite dwellings,
the most of which were shrouded in darkness.</p>

<p>Presently, approaching a gate in the fence, he muttered
to himself:</p>

<p>“I may as well have another look. It’s a hundred
to one there has been nothing doing, though, or I
would have heard it. This evidently isn’t one of the<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
nights for their devilish doings. Hang it, I’m not
sure of it!”</p>

<p>He had stopped short, taking out his electric lamp
and flashing the beam of light on the ornamental
gate. A padlock had been removed and was lying
on the gravel walk within. Nearly at his feet, discovered
after a brief search, was a piece of black
thread.</p>

<p>“By thunder, I was wrong,” Donovan muttered,
gazing around and scowling perplexedly. “Have my
ears gone back on me? Has this scurvy trick been
turned again? Some one has been through this gate
since I tied the thread on it. I’ll darned soon find
out.”</p>

<p>Quietly lifting the latch, Donovan opened the gate
and entered with quickened steps. He did not follow
the gravel walk, which led toward an end door
in a wing of the hospital some fifty yards away. Instead,
he strode straight across the broad lawn,
through the deeper gloom under the trees, until he
came to one, the drooping branches of which formed
a sort of arbor in a secluded part of the extensive
estate.</p>

<p>There was an iron seat under it, and the policeman
flashed his light in that direction. It fell upon
a motionless figure in a huddled position on one end
of the seat&mdash;the figure of a young woman.</p>

<p>“Another, by thunder, as sure as I’m a foot high,”
Donovan gasped audibly. “In spite of my vigilance,
too, and in the same place and condition as the others.
Sure, this beats me.”</p>

<p>Donovan drew nearer and bent over the motionless
girl. She was about nineteen, with a slender,<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
neatly clad figure, a dark skirt and Eton jacket. Her
head was bowed forward, and her hat was somewhat
awry. She was of dark complexion, but the ghastly
pallor of her cheeks caused the policeman to catch
his breath. He bowed over her, listening, and presently
could hear the faint breathing of the unconscious
girl.</p>

<p>“By Jove, I feared for a moment she was gone,”
he said to himself, straightening up. “I’ll try to raise
the sergeant. He said he’d show up about midnight.”</p>

<p>Donovan walked away toward the gate again and
blew his whistle, a shrill, sinister sound on the night
air. Thrice he had to sound it, and then he heard
a distant reply. Several moments later hurried footsteps
fell on the pavement, and an officer in plain
clothes appeared at the gate.</p>

<p>“That you, Jim?” he called quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Donovan’s hand went to his helmet.
“I thought I might get you, Sergeant Brady, as you
said you’d drop around about this time.”</p>

<p>“Something doing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, the same old job.”</p>

<p>“The devil you say! Have you seen no one, nor
heard anything?”</p>

<p>“Not a soul, sir, nor a sound,” Donovan declared,
approaching the gate. “Faith, I think my eyes and
ears have gone to the bad. I was round here twenty
minutes ago. The padlock then was on the gate,
and this thread, tied so that the gate could not be
opened without breaking it, was just as I had fixed
it. It’s a cinch, now, that this is the gate the rascals
have been using. The chief thought, you know, that<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
the padlock might have been taken off only for a
blind. The breaking of the thread settles it.”</p>

<p>“That’s a clever scheme, Jim,” Brady said approvingly.
“Yes, yes, undoubtedly that’s the gate.
Another woman, you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and on the same iron seat.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have a look at her.”</p>

<p>“This way, sergeant.”</p>

<p>“The fourth in a fortnight.” Brady spoke with
a growl while he and his companion strode across
the lawn. “I don’t understand it. I’ll be hanged,
Jim, if I can make head or tail to a mystery of this
kind. I don’t see why it’s done, or who could quit
a winner.”</p>

<p>“Faith, it’s as black as dock mud,” Donovan vouchsafed
grimly. “Here she is, sergeant, dead to the
world.”</p>

<p>Brady stopped and gazed down at the inanimate
girl&mdash;the fourth who had been found on this same
seat, at the same time, and in the same condition,
within two weeks.</p>

<p>“Humph!” Brady grunted, rubbing his furrowed
brow perplexedly. “Mystery is no name for it.”</p>

<p>“Shall I send in an ambulance call?”</p>

<p>“No. It’s another case for the hospital. There’s
nothing in taking her to headquarters and then bringing
her back here, as was done in the other three
cases.”</p>

<p>“Sure, sergeant, that’s right.”</p>

<p>“Go to that wing door and raise one of the attendants.
Tell him what’s up, Jim, and have him
bring out a litter. I’ll wait here until you return.”</p>

<p>Donovan hurried away and vanished around a corner<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
of the wing. He returned in about five minutes,
accompanied by one of the hospital attendants, bearing
a folded litter, which he hastened to open and
on which he and the policeman placed the girl.</p>

<p>While they were doing so, Brady discovered a small
leather hand bag on the ground near the seat. He
picked it up and tossed it on the litter.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” he commanded, a bit gruffly. “Get
a move on. I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p>His companions picked up their burden and obeyed.
They trooped across the grounds and around the
end of the wing, bringing up at a door over which
a red lantern was burning. It was opened by an orderly
within, and Donovan said familiarly:</p>

<p>“Here’s another for you, Bill, of the same sort.
Faith, they seem to drop out of the sky.”</p>

<p>“They more likely are sent up from the infernal
regions, judging from the character of the job,” returned
the orderly. “What’s the matter with you
guns, anyway, that tricks of this kind can be repeated
under your very eyes? Bring her this way.”</p>

<p>He conducted them through a dimly lighted corridor
and into an adjoining room, in which there were
several unoccupied cots, on one of which Donovan
and the attendant placed the girl.</p>

<p>The orderly turned to a wall telephone and summoned
a night nurse, who entered before he had
fairly hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>“What physician is here, Agnes?” he asked curtly.</p>

<p>“Doctor Green has been here since eight o’clock,”
said the nurse. “I just saw a light in Doctor Devoll’s
private room. I think he came in about ten minutes
ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[40]</span></p>

<p>“Notify him,” said the orderly. “He can restore
her, most likely, since he was so successful in the
other three cases. Notify him at once.”</p>

<p>The woman turned to the telephone to speak to
Doctor Devoll, while the orderly set about making a
few necessary preparations to receive him, apparently
disregarding the presence of the two policemen.</p>

<p>Sergeant Brady, who had been gazing with a suspicious
frown at the girl on the cot, turned to the
attendant who had assisted in bringing her in.</p>

<p>“Doctor Devoll is the head physician, isn’t he?”
he asked quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the attendant. “He runs the place.”</p>

<p>“The big finger, eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s what.”</p>

<p>“I have heard he’s very skillful.”</p>

<p>“None better, sir.”</p>

<p>“I wonder&mdash;&mdash;” Brady dropped his voice to a
whisper: “I wonder whether there’s a telephone I
can use on the quiet. I want to talk with Chief Gleason,
at headquarters.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” the attendant nodded. “There’s one in the
operating room. No one is there now. I’ll show
you.”</p>

<p>“Half a minute,” Brady muttered. Then, turning
to Donovan, he whispered: “Have an eye on the
girl, Jim, and keep your ears open when she revives.
Get me?”</p>

<p>“Sure!”</p>

<p>“I’ll return in time to leave with you.”</p>

<p>Donovan nodded, and Brady immediately departed
with the attendant. Only five minutes had passed
when Doctor Devoll entered the room, bringing a<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
leather medicine case and quickly approaching the cot
on which lay the inanimate girl, whose jacket and
the front of her silk shirt waist had been opened by
the nurse.</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll presented quite a striking picture,
when he paused and gazed down at her in the bright
light of an electric bulb. He was close upon sixty
and of medium height, but very slender. His thinness
was accentuated by a tight-fitting black frock
coat, the skirts of which hung to his knees. His
head was almost entirely bald. All that remained to
show that he was a son of Esau was a fringe of close-cut,
gray hair around the base of his skull, and a
single silver-white tuft above his high forehead.</p>

<p>He was smoothly shaven, his features wasted and
wan, his thin lips of a dull, grayish tint, instead of
a wholesome red, as if the blood in his veins had
lost its crimson hue. His nose was long, his eyes a
cold blue and wonderfully penetrating. As he stood
there with his slender hands behind him, his fingers
interlocked, there was something really quite sinister
in his aspect. He looked not unlike a bird of prey
brooding over his victim.</p>

<p>This was immediately dispelled, however, when he
looked up at the nurse and said, with a remarkably
soft and ingratiating voice:</p>

<p>“She appears to be in the same condition, Agnes,
as the others. She was found on the same seat, did
I understand you to say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, doctor.” The nurse bowed to him across
the narrow cot. “This policeman discovered her.
He had her brought in, sir, instead of taking her to
the station house, as before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>Doctor Devoll turned and eyed Donovan narrowly
for a moment; then suavely inquired:</p>

<p>“Is your beat in this locality?”</p>

<p>“It is, sir,” said Donovan respectfully. “I’m the
night patrolman, sir.”</p>

<p>“Are you the officer who previously found the other
girls who were brought here under similar circumstances?”</p>

<p>“I am, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did you see any one to-night, or hear anything,
that might shed a ray of light on this mystery?”</p>

<p>“I did not, sir,” said Donovan. “I’m all in the
dark. I’m blessed if I can fathom how and when
the girl went there. I had my eyes open all the evening
because of the other cases, but how&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, no doubt.” Doctor Devoll checked him
with a deprecatory gesture. “I must apply for more
night men in this district, if these extraordinary episodes
are to continue. The cause must be found and
the culprits discovered. That is, of course, if it’s a
case for the police.”</p>

<p>“She may be a drug fiend, sir, or perhaps&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is useless to speculate,” Doctor Devoll interrupted.
“I could learn nothing from the others. I
will try this one.”</p>

<p>He opened his medicine case while speaking, taking
from it a small sponge and a slender vial filled
with an amber-colored fluid, a few drops of which
he poured on the sponge. Then he held it with
his long, lean fingers near the nostrils of the unconscious
girl.</p>

<p>The effect appeared almost magical. A tinge of
color instantly dispelled her ghastly paleness. She<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
caught her breath with a gasp and a convulsive heave,
as if some potent stimulant had suddenly filled her
lungs, and Doctor Devoll quickly drew away the
sponge and replaced it in his case, hastily closing it.</p>

<p>He scarcely had done so when, with a low moan,
the girl opened her eyes and stared around, then at
her observers, with the mute wonderment of one
awakening amid strange surroundings and in view
of unfamiliar faces. They seemed to alarm and
further stimulate her, for she started up, gasping
amazedly:</p>

<p>“Where&mdash;where am I? Who are you? What has
happened?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed, my girl.” Doctor Devoll’s thin
face took on an assuring smile. “You are in no danger.
You are in the casualty ward of the Osgood
Hospital.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">DOCTOR DEVOLL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Patrolman Donovan drew a little nearer to the cot,
that nothing said or done should escape him. The
orderly had departed, and the announcement by the
physician seemed to surprise and further mystify the
reviving girl.</p>

<p>“A hospital&mdash;in a hospital?” she repeated perplexedly.</p>

<p>“Yes, you were brought here by this policeman,
who found you on a seat in the hospital grounds,”
Doctor Devoll informed her. “You appeared to have
fainted or to have been drugged.”</p>

<p>“I cannot believe that I fainted,” said the girl. “I
don’t understand it. It seems to me as if I had just
awakened from a deep sleep.” She gazed around,
still dazed and deeply puzzled; then asked abruptly:
“What time is it?”</p>

<p>“It is after midnight, nearly one o’clock.”</p>

<p>“One o’clock! Oh, I must go home! I must go
home!”</p>

<p>She started up from the cot, and stood beside it.
She appeared to have regained her strength. Her
color had returned, her eyes were normal, though
expressive of mingled uncertainty and dread.</p>

<p>“Do you feel quite well again?” Doctor Devoll
asked, with sharper scrutiny. “Are you able to go
home?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[45]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes, perfectly able. I must go home; I must
go at once.”</p>

<p>“Before leaving you must give me a few particulars
about yourself,” interposed the physician. “Where
were you when you were overcome? Tell me what
you last remember.”</p>

<p>“I am not sure,” she replied, with a manifest effort
to comply. “I went to the Alhambra, a moving-picture
theater. I had come out and was walking along
Main Street when I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She stopped short, glancing apprehensively at the
policeman. A deep flush suddenly mantled her cheeks.
She hesitated, obviously embarrassed and somewhat
frightened, and Doctor Devoll asked somewhat
sharply:</p>

<p>“Why did you stop? What were you about to
say?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know&mdash;nothing more, sir, I think,” she
faltered. “I have told you all I know&mdash;all I can remember.”</p>

<p>Donovan suspected that she was lying, but he did
not venture to interfere, and Doctor Devoll said quite
sternly:</p>

<p>“Don’t try to conceal anything, my girl. What
happened to you in Main Street? Can’t you remember?”</p>

<p>“Only that I was there, sir; nothing more,” she
insisted. “I was alone and on my way home when
suddenly everything became a blank. I don’t know
what followed, what I did, or where I went. I remember
nothing more until I awoke in this place and
saw you bending over me. I am telling the truth,
sir, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[46]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t question your honesty, my girl,” Doctor
Devoll interposed less austerely. “What is your
name?”</p>

<p>“Mabel Smith, sir,” she admitted, after a moment.</p>

<p>“Where do you live?”</p>

<p>“I board at No. 81 Flint Street with Mrs. Morton,
a widow. I must go home. She will be very anxious
about me and may&mdash;did I have anything when
I was brought in here? I mean my purse.” She
digressed abruptly; then stopped again, with a somewhat
guilty expression in her troubled eyes.</p>

<p>There was a small table near the foot of the cot,
on which the nurse had placed the girl’s hat and a
small, knit purse. The physician glanced at them,
replying:</p>

<p>“Here is your purse, Miss Smith. Was there anything
else?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I think I had a small leather bag,” she replied.</p>

<p>“That appears to be missing.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure,” she quickly added. “I don’t know
positively that I had it with me. If I did, sir, I
suppose I must have dropped it.”</p>

<p>Of the three men who had brought her in from
the seat on which Donovan had found her, Sergeant
Brady was the only one who had seen the small leather
bag, which he had picked up from the ground and
placed on the litter. But Sergeant Brady then was
absent with the attendant, and no further search was
made for the missing bag, for the girl said indifferently:</p>

<p>“It don’t matter, sir. I may not have had it. May
I go home? I really must. You have no right to detain
me here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[47]</span></p>

<p>Donovan did not hear what then passed between
Doctor Devoll and his mysteriously afflicted patient.
The ward door had been opened, and Sergeant Brady
beckoned to the policeman and drew him into the corridor,
closing the door.</p>

<p>“Well, what has she said for herself, Jim?” he
inquired, gazing grimly at the policeman.</p>

<p>“Faith, it’s the same old story, sergeant,” Donovan
replied significantly. “She can’t tell what happened to
her. She don’t know enough to last her overnight.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” Brady grunted. “I suspected as much.”</p>

<p>“She seems to be on the level, though.”</p>

<p>“Level be hanged!” Brady spoke with a derisive
snarl. “None of them was on the level, Jim, or we
would have been able to trace them and find some
solution of the mystery. Not one of them could be
found after she left the hospital.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, sergeant. Sure, it does seem a bit
strange.”</p>

<p>“I got Chief Gleason on the phone by calling up
his house. He had gone home from headquarters.
I reported the case to him, as he directed, and&mdash;say
nothing about this, mind you.”</p>

<p>“Not a word, sergeant.”</p>

<p>“It’s not known by many that the big dick is in town,
and he don’t want it known at present,” Brady impressively
explained. “Nicholas Carter is at the Wilton
House under the name of Blaisdell.”</p>

<p>“Faith, is that so?” Donovan’s face lighted. “Sure,
he can dig out the truth, sergeant, if any man can.”</p>

<p>“Gleason said he would telephone to him at once
and send him here to size up the case,” Brady added.
“He ought to show up within twenty minutes. You<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
return to your beat. I’ll stay here and detain the
girl until Carter comes.”</p>

<p>“All right, sergeant.”</p>

<p>“You can leave by that door through which we
came in. Go ahead. We’ll not want more of you
to-night.”</p>

<p>Donovan touched his helmet and hurried away.</p>

<p>Sergeant Brady gazed after him for a moment;
then turned and entered the wardroom, when an ominous
frown instantly settled on his face.</p>

<p>Miss Mabel Smith had departed.</p>

<p>There remained only the nurse, Agnes, then engaged
in putting the narrow cot in order. Brady
strode toward her, asking roughly:</p>

<p>“Where’s that girl? Not gone, has she?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. She went with Doctor Devoll, sir,
through the corridor leading to the front office,” said
the nurse, pointing to a door at the opposite end of
the wardroom.</p>

<p>“When? How long ago?” Brady demanded.</p>

<p>“Not more than two or three minutes. You might
overtake them, sir, if you hurry. I’ll show you the
way.”</p>

<p>“Do so. I want the girl detained here.”</p>

<p>The nurse hurriedly led the way, Brady striding
after her. They passed through a long corridor leading
to the main part of the building and entered a
brightly lighted office fronting on Hamilton Square.</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll was alone there, closing a roll-top
desk.</p>

<p>“Has that girl gone, doctor?” Brady demanded the
moment he entered.</p>

<p>The physician’s brows fell slightly, and his cold<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
blue eyes took on a sharper glint. He appeared to
resent the officer’s brusqueness. He no further betrayed
it, however, and said, with characteristic blandness:</p>

<p>“She has, sergeant. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Because I wanted to detain her.”</p>

<p>“Detain her? For what?” The physician gazed
more intently.</p>

<p>“For what!” Brady echoed him derisively. “It
strikes me, Doctor Devoll, that this business has gone
far enough. This is the fourth girl brought here in
the same condition, under the same mysterious circumstances,
and allowed to depart before a thorough
investigation was made. Not hide nor hair of them
could afterward be found. She should have been
kept here until we could&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, sergeant,” Doctor Devoll checked him
with a gesture, “you overlook one fact.”</p>

<p>“One fact?”</p>

<p>“This is a hospital, not a police station. I am a
physician, not a detective. My duty is to care for
a patient, if necessary, but not to hold one in custody
after one has recovered. I have no right to do that.
The young lady insisted upon going home, and I
had no proper course but to let her go.”</p>

<p>“All right, doctor, if you look at it in that way,”
said Brady, still frowning darkly.</p>

<p>“There is no other way for me to look at it,” Doctor
Devoll said suavely. “As a matter of fact, however,
you can easily find and question the girl. I
learned her name and address, which I neglected doing
in the previous cases.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[50]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, that’s better!” Brady declared. “Who is
she?”</p>

<p>“Her name is Mabel Smith. She boards at No.
81 Flint Street.”</p>

<p>“Good enough! The matter now can rest until
to-morrow,” said Brady. “May I use your telephone?
I wish to say a word to Mr. Blaisdell, at the Wilton
House.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">GROUNDS FOR SUSPICION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Sergeant Brady got in communication with Nicholas
Carter that night just in time to prevent him
from visiting the hospital, following the telephone
talk he had with Chief Gleason, after the latter had
been notified of this fourth mysterious case.</p>

<p>Carter had not quite finished his breakfast the following
morning, however, at which he was seated
with Chick and Patsy in a private dining room of the
Wilton House, when their waiter brought in a sealed
missive, which the detective opened and read. It
consisted of only two lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I want to see you. I am waiting in the hotel parlor.</p>

<p class="p-1" style="padding-left:15em">“<span class="smcap">Brady</span>.”</p></div>

<p>The detective thrust the note into his pocket and
waved the waiter from the room.</p>

<p>“It’s from Sergeant Brady,” he then said to his
companions. “He is up in the parlor. There must
be something doing, or he would not have called so
early. I’ll drink my coffee and take him up to our
suite. You can join us there.”</p>

<p>“It probably relates to that girl,” said Chick.</p>

<p>“Very likely. He may want my advice or assistance.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t forgotten the autopsy this morning,
chief, in that Todd case, have you?” Patsy reminded
him inquiringly. “You said you wanted to be there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[52]</span></p>

<p>“No, I’ve not forgotten it, Patsy,” said his chief,
rising. “I’ll be there all right, after learning what
Brady has on his mind.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be with you again in five minutes,” Chick
remarked, as the detective was leaving.</p>

<p>Carter found Brady at the parlor door, and he at
once conducted him to his suite on the floor above,
where he produced a box of cigars and invited him
to be seated.</p>

<p>“I slipped in through the side door and sent my
note by your waiter, after learning that you were at
breakfast,” Brady informed him while lighting his
cigar. “If it were known that a police sergeant was
calling upon you, your identity might be suspected.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” Carter admitted. “You did the right
thing, Brady, at all events. What’s on your mind?”</p>

<p>“Gleason sent me. It’s about that girl. I could
not telephone any of the particulars to you last night,
for Doctor Devoll was in the office and heard all I
was saying. He might have suspected that I was
talking with a detective.</p>

<p>“So I merely told you that the girl had gone and
that it would be useless for you to follow the suggestion
made you. I referred, of course, to Chief
Gleason’s communication.”</p>

<p>“I understood you.”</p>

<p>“This morning, however, I have made other discoveries,”
Brady added. “They shed still a worse
light on the case.”</p>

<p>“Did the circumstances last night differ materially
from those of the three other cases about which Gleason
informed me?” the detective inquired.</p>

<p>“No, they were almost identical.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[53]</span></p>

<p>“You need not state them, then. What more have
you discovered?”</p>

<p>Brady told him what Donovan had seen and heard,
nevertheless, and he then added, replying:</p>

<p>“Doctor Devoll asked the girl for her name and
address in this case. She said it was Mabel Smith
and that she boarded at No. 81 Flint Street. I have
been there this morning. The house is occupied by
a man with whom I am well acquainted, and who is
entirely reliable. He knows no girl named Mabel
Smith. She gave Doctor Devoll a fictitious name.”</p>

<p>“I see,” Carter nodded. “That is somewhat significant.”</p>

<p>“I also learned from Donovan, who was present
when the girl revived, that she claimed to have had
a small leather bag. I happen to know that she had,
for I picked it up from the ground near the seat on
which she was found. I placed it on the litter on
which she was taken into the hospital, and I know
it was there when she was taken into the ward.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t it be found?”</p>

<p>“No. Since learning that she gave a false name,
and, thinking the bag might contain something that
would reveal her identity, I have been to the hospital
in search of it.”</p>

<p>“Whom did you see or question?”</p>

<p>“The night nurse and the orderly. Both appear
to be trustworthy. They deny having seen the bag.
The attendant could not have taken it, for he went
with me to the operating room and did not return.
It’s absurd, of course, to suppose Doctor Devoll took
it, and there remains only the girl herself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[54]</span></p>

<p>“Did she have any opportunity to get possession
of it without being seen?” Carter inquired.</p>

<p>“I asked about that, and was told that she was not
seen to find it,” said Brady. “It is barely possible
that she did, nevertheless, and that it contained something
which she did not wish Doctor Devoll to see.”</p>

<p>“Very possibly,” the detective allowed.</p>

<p>“Otherwise, she would have admitted having found
it.”</p>

<p>“That’s reasonable, sergeant.”</p>

<p>“That’s how I size it up,” Brady added. “It seems
to me the only plausible explanation. What I can’t
fathom, however, is why these girls are repeatedly
found unconscious in the hospital grounds, and why
this last one lied in order to hide her identity. Why
were they all so anxious to get away and avoid publicity?”</p>

<p>Nicholas Carter did not express his views. He did
not care to indulge in vain speculations. As a matter
of fact, moreover, he was nearly as puzzled as
the police sergeant by the quite extraordinary circumstances.
He looked up from a figure in the Wilton
carpet, at which he had been thoughtfully gazing,
and asked:</p>

<p>“Have any charges been made at headquarters
or a complaint of any kind that might even indirectly
relate to any of these cases?”</p>

<p>“No, nothing of the kind,” said Brady confidently.
“I’m dead sure of that.”</p>

<p>“Have the police tried in each case to trace and
identify the girl?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, for all they were worth.”</p>

<p>“But with no success at all?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[55]</span></p>

<p>“None whatever. If we could hit upon any motive
for such a job, or see anything to have been gained
by it, we might get on the track of the crooks. For
the fact that all the girls told the same story, and
plainly enough had been drugged or rendered insensible
by some mysterious means, shows that there
must have been trickery of some kind.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you, Brady, in that respect.”</p>

<p>“Strange to say, nevertheless, the victims appeared
anxious only to leave the hospital as quickly as possible
and to bury themselves in obscurity.”</p>

<p>“Have the newspapers reported the previous cases?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, in display type.”</p>

<p>“They must have been read by these girls, then,
and there must be some serious reason for their reticence,”
said Nick. “Very evidently, Brady, there is
something under the surface, something quite out
of the ordinary. Gleason wants me to look into this
last case?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what he wants, Carter.”</p>

<p>“Who is the chief director or head physician of
the Osgood Hospital?”</p>

<p>“Doctor Devoll.”</p>

<p>“He who looked after the girl last night, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He ranks high among the local physicians.
He’s all right, too, I guess.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” the detective agreed. “Well, Brady.
I’ll look into the case. I am to see Chief Gleason
during this morning, and I then will have a talk with
him about it. I infer that you have nothing more
to tell me.”</p>

<p>“No, nothing,” said Brady, rising to go. “You
have got all that I can hand you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[56]</span></p>

<p>Carter sat smoking and frowning at the carpet for
several moments after the sergeant had departed. The
several cases were so unusual, so exceedingly inexplicable,
that they interested him. Had there been
only one such case, only one girl found in the hospital
grounds, he would have considered it hardly
worthy of his serious attention; but four in such close
proximity to each other, and so much alike, plainly
proved that they were victims of some person or persons.</p>

<p>His reflections were ended by the entrance of Chick
and Patsy only two or three minutes after Brady departed,
and he briefly told them what the sergeant
stated, both already being informed of the other circumstances.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” said Patsy, after hearing him attentively.
“It sure is a curious puzzle, chief. What do
you make of it, and how are you going to tackle it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t make much of it, Patsy, at present,” his
chief frankly admitted. “There must be a very potent
cause for the reticence of all four girls and for
their obvious wish to remain in the background.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. That goes without saying.”</p>

<p>“It’s barely possible that they are in league with
crooks who were responsible for what befell them,
and that they do not dare to come forward and tell
the truth.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe so, chief,” Patsy nodded.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, the whole business may be the
work of some exceedingly keen and clever rascal who,
alone and with some ulterior object in view, has been
experimenting with these girls and paving the way to
a much more knavish project,” the detective added.<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
“If that is correct, it’s a hundred to one that he is
the unknown crook who committed the mysterious
robberies mentioned by Gleason, and whom he is so
anxious to round up.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, there may be something in that!” Chick
said quickly. “It appears to be the most probable
explanation.”</p>

<p>“I think so, too.”</p>

<p>“But what are your plans, chief?” asked Patsy
earnestly. “How are we to pick up a trail worth following?”</p>

<p>“By finding that girl who said her name was Mabel
Smith,” the chief replied pointedly. “That must
be done, to begin with, and then we’ll go a step further.”</p>

<p>“But how can we trace her?”</p>

<p>“That’s up to you, Chick.”</p>

<p>“Up to me, eh?”</p>

<p>“It’s the task you must tackle this morning,” said
Carter. “We have a great deal to accomplish to-day,
and each must do his part. I wish to follow
up the Todd case, with Patsy to aid me. You had
better go to the hospital, Chick, and get after that
girl. I have no great faith in Brady’s discernment
and acumen. You could discover more in a minute,
Chick, than he would learn in a month of Sundays.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll take it on, chief,” Chick said agreeably.
“I may perhaps pick up a thread. I’ll report when
we meet for lunch.”</p>

<p>“In the meantime, Patsy, in anticipation of what
I expect an autopsy to reveal, I want you to visit the
office of Daly &amp; Page, stock brokers, and see what
you quietly can learn about Gaston Todd,” the detective<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
directed. “You are not known in Madison,
and your motive will not be suspected. You may
cover that, if you like, by pretending to be a newspaper
reporter.”</p>

<p>“Enough said,” replied Patsy. “I’ve got you,
chief.”</p>

<p>“Not entirely,” Nick rejoined. “Find out at just
what time Todd left the office yesterday, and whether
it was his customary time of going out in the middle
of the day. If not, make it a point to learn, if possible,
why he went out at an unusual time. He may
have received a letter, or a telephone call, or a communication
by messenger.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said Patsy. “Leave it to me.”</p>

<p>“In other words,” said Carter, “I want to learn
why Todd went to the Waldmere Chambers about
noon, and why he was waiting in the corridor, where
Frank Paulding saw him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll find out, chief, if possible.”</p>

<p>“It may be necessary to take other steps later in
order to hit the right trail,” Carter said in conclusion.
“I will decide about that after learning what
the autopsy reveals. I’ll see the coroner and medical
examiner this morning.”</p>

<p>“We may as well be off, then, and get in our work,”
said Chick.</p>

<p>“The sooner the better,” the detective declared,
glancing at his watch. “It is now nine o’clock. We’ll
meet here again at one.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE YELLOW COUPON.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was half past nine when Chick sauntered across
Hamilton Square and sized up the buildings and
grounds of the Osgood Hospital. He had learned
from his chief the general lay of the land, so to speak,
and continued around the extensive park and grounds,
seeking the rear gate through which Mabel Smith,
so called, had either entered or been carried into the
place.</p>

<p>He was not long in finding the gate, and he then
discovered a gardener at work near by with a lawn
mower. Entering with an air of cursory interest only,
he approached him and inquired:</p>

<p>“Is there any objection to my looking around a
bit?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I reckon not,” said the laborer.</p>

<p>“I’ll not disturb anything.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, sir. Go as far as you like.”</p>

<p>Chick sauntered up the gravel walk, and presently
discovered the iron seat on which the girl had been
found. He walked over to it across the lawn and
sat down, in seeming enjoyment of the shade tree
overhanging it, but in reality to make a careful inspection
of the surrounding ground.</p>

<p>He could discover in the greensward at first only
the marks left by the feet of the two policemen, whose
heavy and lingering tread had obliterated any other
imprints that might have been there when they arrived<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
upon the spot. As he was about to go, however,
he caught sight of a small piece of a yellow card
half hidden in the grass back of the seat. He leaned
over and picked it up.</p>

<p>It was part of a theater ticket, the coupon for a
seat, and it was dated for the previous evening.</p>

<p>“The Alhambra,” Chick read. “By Jove, that’s the
theater from which the girl said she had come. She
evidently did not lie from start to finish. H’m! This
may help.”</p>

<p>He had detected a faint aroma from the coupon,
and he held it nearer to his nostrils.</p>

<p>“Violet perfumery, but of an inferior quality,” he
said to himself. “That indicates that she’s a girl of
only moderate means, who cannot afford an expensive
extract. She carried the ticket in a bag with her
handkerchief, which was scented. This may start me
on the right scent, too, and I’ll proceed to follow it up.”</p>

<p>Placing the coupon in his notebook, he sauntered
back across the lawn and passed out through the gate.
He then saw that there was a narrow court beyond
a row of dwellings on the opposite side of the street,
which evidently was an outlet into the streets beyond.</p>

<p>Crossing over, he walked in that direction, and as
he was passing the third house from the court he saw
a polished brass plate on the vestibule door:</p>

<p>“Gordon Barclay. Artist.”</p>

<p>Chick stopped short and gazed up at the door.</p>

<p>“By Jove, this must be Don Barclay,” he muttered.
“It’s not likely that there are two artists by that name.
I’ve not seen him for years. I’ll take a chance that
I’m right and will meet an old friend.”</p>

<p>He mounted the steps and rang the bell. A butler<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
admitted him and vanished with his card on a
silver tray. Presently, with hurried steps that evinced
a very genuine eagerness, a well-built, handsome man
in a velvet jacket rushed into the room, with eyes
and cheeks aglow and his hands extended in cordial
greeting.</p>

<p>“Holy smoke, Chick Carter! The one and only
Chick himself!” he shouted. “Gracious, but I’m glad
to see you! How the dickens came you here? You’re
not after me, are you?”</p>

<p>Chick laughed, and returned the speaker’s cordial
greeting.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, Don, nothing like that,” he replied.
“I’m in Madison on other business. I was passing this
house only by chance, and I saw your door plate.”</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven, you didn’t overlook it!”</p>

<p>“And it occurred to me that we have not met for
three years&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Four, you rascal!” Barclay cut in boisterously.
“It was on a boxing night at the Hudson Athletic
Club. I remember it perfectly.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Don.”</p>

<p>“Sure, Chick, it’s right. By Jove, you’re a sight for
sore eyes! Come to the dining room and we’ll fire
a ball. Then I’ll take you up to my studio and show
you where I’m winning fame and fortune by slinging
paint. That’s on the top floor. We’ll have a
smoke and a good old-fashioned chat. By gracious,
I’m glad to see you!”</p>

<p>There was no doubting it. It stuck out all over the
genial, vivacious artist, and for nearly an hour Chick
complied with his wishes and responded to his running
fire of questions. Then, during a lull in their<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
conversation, he turned it upon the matter more seriously
engaging him.</p>

<p>“Now, Don, a word about my mission in Madison,”
said he, dropping the end of his cigar on a tray. “I
know you may be trusted to say nothing about it.”</p>

<p>“Not a word, Chick,” Barclay assured him. “Come
on with it.”</p>

<p>“You read the newspapers, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Only the headlines,” laughed the artist. “The details
give me a confounded headache.”</p>

<p>“You may not know about it, then,” said Chick.
“I’m here to help clear up quite a sensational mystery
in this immediate locality.”</p>

<p>“Thunder! You don’t say so. Why, I thought
the old fogies who dwell in this locality were too slow
and sedate to get into anything more sensational than
the death column.”</p>

<p>“I will confide the case to you.”</p>

<p>He did so briefly, merely stating the main features
of the previous night, and a look of mingled surprise
and amusement then appeared in the artist’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, by gracious, that’s jolly funny!” he declared,
drawing up in his chair.</p>

<p>“Funny! What do you mean?” Chick inquired.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s like this,” Barclay proceeded to explain.
“I use this top floor for my studio, where I get the
best light. I was at work here quite late last night.
It must have been nearly midnight. Here, come this
way. Come to the window.”</p>

<p>Chick arose and accompanied him to a broad window
overlooking most of the square, including the
hospital building and grounds. Only a small part<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
of the grounds was hidden from view by the building
itself.</p>

<p>“Last night, just after I finished my work, I looked
out here for a breath of fresh air,” Barclay resumed.
“It was quite dark down below, but I caught sight of
a motor cab, one of the noiseless type that is run by
electricity, for it moved without a sound. I followed
it with my eyes, having nothing better to do, and I
saw it stop at a gate leading into the hospital grounds.”</p>

<p>“That rear gate beyond the west wing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the same.” Barclay turned and nodded. “Do
you suppose it figured in the case you mentioned?”</p>

<p>“I would not be surprised,” Chick said a bit grimly.
“Continue. What more did you see?”</p>

<p>“Nothing very definite,” Barclay said. “I was not
watching the cab suspiciously or with a very lively
interest, though it struck me as being rather singular
that it stopped at that gate, instead of in front of the
hospital, or at a house on this side of the street, if the
occupants were going there.”</p>

<p>“Did you see any one enter the cab or leave it?”</p>

<p>“I did not. Notice that the trees obstruct the view
somewhat, and the lamps are all on this side. I am
sure, however, that no one crossed the street,” Barclay
quickly added. “I would have seen him in that
case. Obviously, therefore, if any one left the cab,
he must have gone into the hospital grounds.”</p>

<p>“That is what I suspect,” said Chick. “Which
way did the cab go when departing?”</p>

<p>“Straight on and around the square. I know it did
not return for ten minutes at least, if at all, for I
stood here smoking as long as that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[64]</span></p>

<p>“You saw no one, then, nor heard anything?”</p>

<p>“No, neither.”</p>

<p>“From which direction did the cab come?”</p>

<p>“Through the court at the end of this block,” said
Barclay, pointing. “It leads out into Belmont Street.”</p>

<p>“You think it was an electric cab?”</p>

<p>“I’m almost sure of that.”</p>

<p>“How long did it remain at the gate?”</p>

<p>“Not more than a couple of minutes,” said Barclay.
“Do you really think it figures in your affair?”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, Don, I think there is hardly
any doubt of it,” Chick said seriously. “In a way,
however, it serves only to increase the mystery.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite see your point.”</p>

<p>“My point is this,” Chick explained. “Why did
the person, or persons, responsible for this curious
affair go to the trouble to bring the victim, if she was
a victim, and place her on a seat in the hospital
grounds? She could have been left in many places
with much less danger of detection. In the court
itself or a dark doorway. It surely is a singular
mystery.”</p>

<p>Barclay puckered his brows thoughtfully, but he
could suggest no theory for the circumstances. Moreover,
he could not give the detective any additional
information.</p>

<p>Declining an invitation to remain to dinner, Chick
remained only to warn the artist to say nothing about
the affair, and he then bade him farewell and departed.
He did not retrace his steps. Instead, he
sauntered through the court mentioned, which was
only wide enough for a single vehicle, and he presently
found himself in Belmont Street, a quiet residential<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
avenue, with a traffic-filled thoroughfare to be seen in
the distance.</p>

<p>“By Jove, it looks very much as if I am hitting
the right trail,” Chick said to himself, now shaping
a course toward the business section. “If the girl
left the Alhambra when the show ended, it then must
have been about eleven o’clock, and if she lost consciousness
while walking homeward through Main
Street, it’s a safe gamble that she did not go far in
her abnormal condition. She may have been picked
up by the cab, therefore, and brought this way and
through the court just as Barclay was gazing from
his window. It would have taken only a couple of
minutes to place the girl on the seat and move on,
as he stated, which would show plainly that one or
more men had a hand in the job. But what was the
object? That’s the question. By Jove, I’ll head for
the Alhambra and see what I can learn.”</p>

<p>He arrived at the moving-picture house ten minutes
later. He found the manager, Mr. Hewitt, in the
ticket office with one of his sellers. Addressing him
through the lattice window, at the same time tendering
the yellow coupon, he inquired:</p>

<p>“Do you know, or have you any way of learning,
who occupied this seat in your theater last evening?”</p>

<p>Hewitt gazed at him a bit sharply through his
glasses; then shook his head and tossed the coupon
aside, saying indifferently:</p>

<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think so?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said.”</p>

<p>“Are you the manager?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[66]</span></p>

<p>Chick did not fancy being treated in that way. He
pressed a little nearer to the window, and said, with
sinister intonation:</p>

<p>“You take a tip from me, Mr. Manager, and have
another think. Make it a more serious one this time.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” frowned Hewitt.</p>

<p>“Just what I say,” Chick replied, turning the lap
of his vest and displaying his detective’s badge.</p>

<p>Hewitt started perceptibly, and flushed deeply.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s different; very different,” he said in
tones of hasty apology. “I did not suppose it was a
matter of any importance.”</p>

<p>“I don’t waste my time or encroach upon that of
others with unimportant matters,” Chick replied
coldly. “Have a look at the coupon now, and give
me the information I want, if possible. Can you tell
who occupied the seat?”</p>

<p>“Well, really, sir, I hardly think so,” Hewitt now
said regretfully. “In a theater of this size&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop a moment, sir,” interrupted his assistant, who
was also inspecting the coupon. “This was torn from
a ticket sold by telephone and held until called for.
Here is a mark of my indelible pencil on the back
of it.”</p>

<p>“Do you write the patron’s name on the back of a
ticket when it is to be held till called for?” asked
Chick.</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly. But only the tail of the last letter
happened to fall on the coupon,” said the assistant.
“It contains no part of the name. See for
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Very true,” Chick admitted. “But what has become
of that part of the ticket taken at the door?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>“The stubs?”</p>

<p>“If that’s what you call them. Have they been
destroyed? No two coupons are torn off exactly
alike. We might find the ticket that this coupon perfectly
matches, as well as these pencil lines, that would
give us the name of the purchaser.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, sir, that’s as true as gospel!” Hewitt declared.
“No, the stubs have not been destroyed. I
threw them into my wastebasket last evening after
making up the house. They still are there.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have a look at them.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir, and I’ll assist you,” Hewitt readily
assented. “Open the door, Jim, for the gentleman
to enter. Walk into my private office, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Chickering,” said Chick dryly.</p>

<p>“We’ll very soon examine them, Mr. Chickering,”
Hewitt added, pulling a wastebasket from under his
desk. “Take a seat. We need to examine only the
yellow stubs and those having a name on them, and
that may be quickly done.”</p>

<p>It was not in Chick’s nature to nurse resentment,
and he now met the much more gracious manager
halfway. Less than fifty of the stubs had been inspected
and compared with the coupon when the desired
one was found. There could be no mistaking
it, and on the back of it was written the name: “Nellie
Fielding.”</p>

<p>Hewitt called in his assistant and questioned him,
showing him the ticket.</p>

<p>“That’s your writing, Jim,” said he. “Do you
remember selling the woman the ticket, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Remember&mdash;sure thing,” interrupted the other.<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
“She comes here every week. I know her well by
sight and where she works.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” said Chick, suppressing his elation.
“Where is she employed?”</p>

<p>“She’s a waitress in Boyden’s restaurant, in Middle
Street. You’ll find her there at any hour of the
day.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Chick bowed, with a glance from one
to the other. “I’m obliged to both of you.”</p>

<p>He lingered only to warn them not to communicate
with the girl; then he shook hands with both and hurried
from the theater.</p>

<p>“Now, by Jove, there’ll be something doing,” he
said to himself, much as if he had thus far been idle.
“I’ll mighty soon find out why the milk is in the
coconut.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">SUSPICIONS VERIFIED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Nicholas Carter and his assistants were never slow
in beginning to weave a net in which to catch a culprit
when the evidence and circumstances in a case convinced
them that a crime had been committed.</p>

<p>Patsy Garvan, while Chick was engaged as described,
was nearly as successful as the latter in picking
up the first strands with which the net might
be formed. Hastening to the brokerage office of Daly
&amp; Page, he introduced himself to the latter, the former
then having gone to the local stock exchange, and
requested a few facts concerning the history and character
of Mr. Gaston Todd, whose very sudden death
had greatly shocked his many friends in Madison.</p>

<p>“He was a fine fellow,” Page glibly informed him.
“Genial, honest, and capable, devoted to our interests,
and always at his desk in business hours. That’s
pretty good, isn’t it? That’s all we require of a man.”</p>

<p>“That would seem to fill the bill, sir,” Patsy observed
a bit dryly.</p>

<p>“It does,” said the broker. “And what such a man
does out of business hours, of what his habits and
deportment consist, are of little importance to us.
Todd served us faithfully for ten years. We shall
miss him. We shall, indeed!”</p>

<p>“He died very suddenly,” said Patsy. “Had you
any idea that he was afflicted with any ailment?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[70]</span></p>

<p>“No, not the slightest. His death came like a bolt
from the blue.”</p>

<p>“Was he regular in his habits?”</p>

<p>“Very.”</p>

<p>“I understand that he left here about twelve o’clock.
Did he usually go out at that time?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, he did not.” Page gazed more sharply
at his questioner. “He usually lunched at one o’clock.”</p>

<p>“He may have had some mission to attend to for
the firm, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, nothing of that kind. He was our cashier,
and his duty kept him here. You raise a point, young
man, that has not occurred to me. By the way,
Archie,” Page called to a clerk who had served in
Todd’s place when the latter was absent, “come here
a moment. Do you know why Todd went out an
hour earlier than usual yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not sure, sir,” replied the clerk. “I think
it was because of a telephone message.”</p>

<p>“Do you know from whom?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I know only that he was called to the
telephone just before noon. When he returned he
asked me to take his place in the cage, saying that he
was going out for a few minutes. That’s all I know
about it.”</p>

<p>That was all of any importance that Patsy was able
to learn, but it was sufficient to send him posthaste to
the office of the telephone exchange. There he stated
his mission to the manager, who conducted him into
a room where three girl operators were seated at a
large switchboard.</p>

<p>“Look at your record sheets for yesterday,” said
the manager, addressing them. “Which of you made<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
a connection for Daly &amp; Page, 442 West, just before
twelve o’clock?”</p>

<p>One of the girls replied in a few minutes, after inspecting
a large sheet of paper taken from a drawer:</p>

<p>“I did, sir, and I now remember it distinctly,” she
said. “It was the last I made before going to lunch.”</p>

<p>“Is there any way of learning who made the call?”
Patsy inquired.</p>

<p>“Only by ringing up Daly &amp; Page and asking them,”
said the manager.</p>

<p>“They do not know,” said Patsy. “The call was not
for the firm.”</p>

<p>“It was for a man named Todd,” put in the operator.</p>

<p>“How did you learn that?”</p>

<p>“I heard a few words that were said before I removed
my receiver,” explained the girl. “The man
who rang up the number said he wanted to talk with
Mr. Todd, and half a minute later I heard him ask:
‘Is that you, Todd?’”</p>

<p>“Are you sure it was a man’s voice?”</p>

<p>“Yes, positively.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear him say anything more?”</p>

<p>“I heard Todd reply in the affirmative. The other
then said, as near as I can remember, that he was
Todd’s running mate who was talking, and that Todd
must go at once to the Waldmere Chambers and wait
in the second-floor corridor until the speaker could
join him.”</p>

<p>“That was all?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I heard the last while I was removing
the receiver. It is only by chance that I remember
it. His calling himself Todd’s running mate, however,<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
sounded so singular to me that I listened for a
moment longer. That is all I can tell you.”</p>

<p>Patsy thanked her, also the manager, and departed.</p>

<p>It then was about the time when Nick Carter entered
the Madison mortuary, to which all that remained
of Gaston Todd had been taken, and where the
autopsy was to be performed. It was finished, in
fact, or all that then could be done, when Nick entered,
and he found only Coroner Kane and Doctor
Marvin, the district medical examiner, in the superintendent’s
office. He scarce had arrived there, however,
when Chief Gleason followed him in from the
street.</p>

<p>Nick already had introduced himself to the others,
with whom an appointment for him had been made
by the chief, and, after a few conventional preliminaries,
he brought up the business engaging them.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the verdict, Doctor Marvin?” he inquired.
“You say you have made a thorough examination
of the body.”</p>

<p>“Not quite,” corrected the physician, glancing at
a leather bag on the floor. “There are parts of the
body of which I wish to make a microscopic examination
and subject to chemical analysis. I do say, however,
that you should have been a physician, Mr. Carter,
despite the fact that you would be badly missed
in your present vocation.”</p>

<p>“You mean, I infer, that you wonder why I so
quickly suspected that Todd did not die from natural
causes,” said the detective.</p>

<p>“Exactly. On what do you base your suspicion?”</p>

<p>“On several facts, doctor, which are hardly worthy
of mention,” Nick said indifferently. “The surrounding<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
circumstances, Todd’s outward indications of good
health, a lingering expression denoting mingled fright
and horror, evinced also by an unusual dilation of his
pupils&mdash;these, together with a singular abnormal appearance
of the skin near the lips and nostrils. But
the result of your own examination is much more
material,” he abruptly digressed. “What is your opinion?”</p>

<p>“The same as your own,” said Doctor Marvin more
gravely.</p>

<p>“You found&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That there was absolutely no organic disease. His
vital organs were apparently in a perfectly healthy condition.
I can discover no natural cause for Todd’s
sudden death.”</p>

<p>“Did you notice the singular condition I have mentioned?”
Nick inquired.</p>

<p>“I did,” said the physician. “I detect it, or a somewhat
similar condition, in the tissues of the lungs.
They have a curious, withered or cauterized appearance.”</p>

<p>“Have you any opinion as to the cause?”</p>

<p>“I would say it was caused by inhaling some very
powerful corrosive gas, possibly of a deadly nature,
though from what it was derived or how administered
I cannot imagine, even if I am right. I am going to
submit them to tests, however, also the blood, that
may enable me to form a more definite opinion and
solve the problem.”</p>

<p>“Do you think there is any problem, doctor, or any
doubt, to put it more properly, that Gaston Todd died
an unnatural death?”</p>

<p>“No, not the slightest, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[74]</span></p>

<p>“Do you think it the result of a crime?”</p>

<p>“Well, I think the circumstances warrant very serious
suspicions,” Doctor Marvin said gravely.</p>

<p>“So do I,” Nick declared. “As a matter of fact,
gentlemen, I feel reasonably sure that Gaston Todd
was, with some strange and atrocious means, most
foully murdered.”</p>

<p>“We agree with you,” Coroner Kane now asserted.
“There are other circumstances which warrant that
suspicion.”</p>

<p>“You mean?”</p>

<p>“They involve a young man known to have had feelings
of bitter enmity for Todd, with whom he had an
angry altercation night before last and who was seen
leaving the Waldmere Chambers only a minute or two
before Todd was found dead on the corridor floor.”</p>

<p>“Do you refer to Frank Paulding?” the detective inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes. How did you learn about him, Mr. Carter?”
inquired the coroner, with a look of surprise.</p>

<p>“Chief Gleason spoke of him to me and mentioned
their unfriendly relations,” Nick explained, but he said
nothing about his interview with Paulding. “He was
seen leaving the Waldmere Chambers, you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We have found two witnesses and the time
is definitely fixed. Though they were not seen to
meet, we are reasonably sure that they did, and that
Paulding hurried out of the building and up the
street immediately afterward.”</p>

<p>“All that does appear suspicious,” Nick agreed, not
without an object. “Have you questioned Paulding?”
he added, turning to Chief Gleason.</p>

<p>“No, not yet,” replied the latter. “I have followed<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
your advice and waited until after the autopsy. I have
had Paulding under espionage since last evening.”</p>

<p>“A wise precaution, chief.”</p>

<p>“What do you now advise?” Gleason added. “It
strikes me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If the circumstances are incriminating, as you
say,” Nick interrupted, “I think it will be wise to arrest
Paulding and hold him until after Doctor Marvin’s
further investigations. If we can prove positively
that Todd was murdered, we may build up a
strong case against the lawyer and possibly force a
confession from him.”</p>

<p>“I already have decided on that step, Mr. Carter,”
said the coroner. “See to it, Gleason. Have Paulding
arrested as soon as possible, chief, and held on suspicion.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE DEEPER MYSTERY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Nick Carter returned to the Wilton House at one
o’clock. He found Chick and Patsy waiting for him,
both of whom quickly told him what they had learned
that morning, and then heard his own brief report of
the inquest.</p>

<p>“By Jove, you were right!” Chick then said seriously.
“It now is a cinch that Todd was murdered.”</p>

<p>“I felt reasonably sure of it from the first,” the detective
replied.</p>

<p>“But who killed him?” put in Patsy. “That’s the
question. You say you are sure, chief, that Paulding
did not do it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, absolutely.”</p>

<p>“What’s your game, then? Why did you frame up
a deal with him, telling him he might not be suspected
and afterward advise having him arrested?”</p>

<p>“Superficially, Patsy, that does appear quite inconsistent,”
said Nick, smiling. “In reality, however, I
called on Paulding only to get his measure and convince
myself of his innocence. I want him arrested,
nevertheless, in order that Todd’s assassin, as to whose
identity and motive we are entirely in the dark, may
think the police are sure they have the right man.
That will relieve him of fears that otherwise would
put him on his guard. We then can get in our work
with much less difficulty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[77]</span></p>

<p>“There is something in that, chief, all right,” Patsy
quickly allowed.</p>

<p>“It’s up to us to find the right man, however, and
now a word about your report,” Nick added. “From
what little the telephone girl heard, it is very evident
that Todd was called to the Waldmere Chambers and
directed to wait in the corridor either by the man
who killed him or by a man in league with or acting
under the instructions of the assassin. In other words,
Todd was lured there only to be murdered.”</p>

<p>“Plainly enough,” Chick agreed. “We can safely
bank on that.”</p>

<p>“We know, too, that Paulding then was in the building
to confer with a client,” Carter continued. “Being
convinced of his innocence, I know it was not he who
telephoned to Todd.”</p>

<p>“Surely not.”</p>

<p>“The fact that he was there, however, is very significant.”</p>

<p>“Of what, chief?” questioned Patsy.</p>

<p>“He may have been seen by some person anxious
to kill Todd and who, knowing their unfriendly relations,
and that Paulding would presently leave, took
advantage of the situation to lure Todd there, taking
a chance that he could kill him unobserved by others
immediately after Paulding departed, believing that
the latter then would be suspected.”</p>

<p>“That’s plausible,” Chick nodded.</p>

<p>“And that’s why Todd was directed to wait in the
corridor,” Carter pointed out. “The assassin wanted
him to be there when Paulding left the building. The
fact that he was not seen by Paulding, however, and
that he could confidently plan such a crime, as well as<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
commit it, without being seen or heard, shows that he
must have had several advantages. He may be a
tenant in the building. It would not be easy or discreet
for an outsider to have undertaken it.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, by Jove, and quite suggestive.”</p>

<p>“Furthermore, he evidently knew that Todd would
obey his instructions or his commands, which indicates
that he may have had a hold on him of some
kind. Otherwise, Todd might not have left his desk
in business hours to keep the appointment.”</p>

<p>“True again, chief.”</p>

<p>“He referred to himself as Todd’s running mate,
moreover, if the telephone girl heard correctly,” said
Nick. “Plainly, then, they have been intimately related
in some way, either in business or as friends, and
Todd naturally would not have apprehended anything
like assassination.”</p>

<p>“Surely not, chief,” said Patsy.</p>

<p>“We next must learn, therefore, with whom Todd
was specially friendly, and whom he has been visiting
in the Waldmere Chambers.”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff, chief, for fair.”</p>

<p>“You set about it this afternoon, Patsy,” Carter
directed. “Now, Chick, concerning Nellie Fielding.
You have not seen her?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said Chick. “It was nearly one o’clock
when I left the Alhambra, and I decided to report to
you and have a bite to eat before seeking the girl.
I warned Hewitt and his ticket seller not to communicate
with her.”</p>

<p>“See her after lunch, then, and be governed by what
she says and how she appears,” Carter directed. “It<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
may be wise to shadow her, in case she is playing a
deeper game than appears on the surface. If alarmed
by your inquiries, she may attempt to warn others.”</p>

<p>“Possibly. I’ll keep an eye on her, chief, at all
events.”</p>

<p>“There may be a connection between the several
cases, Todd’s murder and the mystery involving these
four girls,” Carter added. “I shall see Doctor Devoll
this afternoon. I want to know just what he
thinks about them, and the strange condition in which
they were found.”</p>

<p>It was three o’clock when Chick approached Boyden’s
restaurant in Middle Street. A man of middle
age was standing in the doorway, whose interest in
the appearance of one of the adjoining windows denoted
that he was the proprietor. He walked out, and
was to leave in a moment, when Chick, without having
approached near enough to be seen from within,
paused and asked:</p>

<p>“Are you Mr. Boyden?”</p>

<p>“I am,” said the latter. “Were you looking for
me?”</p>

<p>“I want to inquire about a girl in your employ.
It is in connection with some legal investigations, but
in which the girl figures only indirectly,” Chick blandly
explained. “Her name is Nellie Fielding.”</p>

<p>“What do you wish to learn about her?” Boyden
questioned.</p>

<p>“How long has she been working for you?”</p>

<p>“About a year.”</p>

<p>“Is she married?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed. She is only nineteen, and is the only
support of a crippled sister.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[80]</span></p>

<p>“That speaks well for her,” Chick remarked tentatively.</p>

<p>“Not more so than she deserves,” Boyden quickly
assured him. “Nellie is a very good girl, none better,
sir, as far as that goes. She has no means beyond
what she earns, but she is strictly honest and reliable.”</p>

<p>“Her character and habits are good?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, or she would not be in my employ.”</p>

<p>“I want to talk with her for a few moments.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead. You’ll find her at the office counter.
She acts as my cashier when I am out. I have an appointment,
or I would go in and introduce you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, but that is not necessary,” said Chick.
“I want only a few words with her.”</p>

<p>Boyden bowed and departed without replying, and
Chick turned toward the restaurant door. The information
he had received was all to the girl’s credit.
It denoted that evil and deception were entirely foreign
to her nature. Chick knew that she had lied to
Doctor Devoll, nevertheless, and he was determined
to learn for what reason.</p>

<p>There were only a few scattered patrons in the restaurant
at that hour, and he found Nellie Fielding
at leisure, standing behind a small counter on which
were a cash register and a cigar case. He approached
and bought some cigars from her, at once favorably
impressed with her neat appearance and modest bearing.</p>

<p>“You are Miss Fielding, I believe,” he remarked
while paying her.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” she replied, smiling at him over the cash
register. “That is my name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[81]</span></p>

<p>“There is a little matter about which I wish to question
you,” said Chick. “I refer to what occurred last
evening when you&mdash;there, don’t be alarmed!” he
quickly digressed. “There is nothing for you to fear,
Miss Fielding, if you have done nothing wrong, and
I feel quite sure that you have not.”</p>

<p>She had turned very pale, with a frightened expression
leaping up in her eyes. She shrank from him,
trembling perceptibly, until his hasty assurance somewhat
relieved her.</p>

<p>“No, no, I have done nothing wrong, sir,” she protested,
with quite pathetic fervor. “How did you
know&mdash;how did you learn about it? I did only what
I&mdash;oh, sir, I could see nothing else to do! I&mdash;I wanted
to avoid publicity.”</p>

<p>“Compose yourself,” Chick said quietly. “I can
see quite plainly that you were more sinned against
than sinner. You have nothing to fear from me, Miss
Fielding, if you tell me the truth, and I think there
will be no need for any publicity.”</p>

<p>“Are you a policeman?” she asked tremulously.</p>

<p>“I am a detective,” Chick admitted. “You must not
mention it to others, however, or the fact that I have
questioned you. There have been other cases very
like your own, Miss Fielding, and I am quietly investigating
them. You must tell me the truth, therefore,
and I think I can safely assure you that it will be
only to your advantage. Will you do so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” she replied, much relieved by Chick’s
kindly voice and manner. “As a matter of fact, sir,
I really have nothing to conceal. I am anxious only
to avoid publicity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>“That is why you gave Doctor Devoll a fictitious
name?” Chick asked, smiling.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” Nellie admitted, coloring deeply. “But
I had one other reason also.”</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you just what occurred. You then will
understand and perhaps will appreciate my feelings.”</p>

<p>“I think so.” Chick bowed. “Tell me frankly.
I would be glad to befriend you in any way.”</p>

<p>“It was like this, sir.” The girl leaned nearer to
him over the show case and spoke with lowered voice.
“I had been alone to the Alhambra, and the show was
an unusually long one. It was after eleven o’clock
when it ended. I came out with the crowd and turned
up Main Street to go home. I had walked only a
short distance, not more than a block, and the sidewalk
still was quite crowded, when I felt something
touch my hand. I turned quickly and glanced at the
nearest person, but none seemed to have any interest
in me or to be the one who had left it.”</p>

<p>“Left what?” Chick inquired curiously.</p>

<p>“The leather bag.” Miss Fielding gazed at him
more intently, as if really glad to have found some
one in whom she could confide and depend upon for
advice. “The leather bag&mdash;it had been placed in my
hand by some person. That is to say, sir, I now
think that it was, though I then was not quite sure
of it.”</p>

<p>“Why so? Explain,” said Chick attentively.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, there were many people passing in each
direction at the time, and it all occurred so quickly
and was so very singular that I was quite confused.
But there was the leather bag in my right hand, and<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
I thought at first that I might accidentally have torn
it from the belt or the long neck chain of some passing
woman. I could see no woman near me, however,
and I now feel sure that the bag was quickly and
stealthily placed in my hand.”</p>

<p>“That was, indeed, a strange experience,” said
Chick. “What did you do about it? What followed?”</p>

<p>“I looked for some one from whom I could have
accidentally taken it or who might have given it to
me,” Nellie continued. “As I already have said, however,
no one appeared to have any interest in me, and
there was no woman near me.”</p>

<p>“Was it a woman’s hand bag or a purse?”</p>

<p>“It was more like a small purse, one that could
be easily held in one hand,” Nellie explained. “I felt
the shape and heard the clink of coins in it, moreover,
which made me think it was a purse. And then I&mdash;oh,
sir, I’m only a poor girl, dependent upon what I
earn to support myself and a crippled sister&mdash;I thought
I had come into possession of some money. I did
wrong. I was impelled to keep it. I yielded to temptation.
I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All that was perfectly natural, Miss Fielding, under
the circumstances,” Chick kindly interposed when
tears suddenly appeared in her blue eyes. “You cannot
be consistently blamed. Tell me what you did and
what followed?”</p>

<p>“When I saw that I was not observed, or so it then
appeared, I concealed the bag under my coat and hurried
on for a short distance, until I could safely look
into it and learn what it contained. I did so under<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
a lamp on a corner, when well away from the crowd
that had left the theater.”</p>

<p>“What did you find in the bag?” Chick inquired.</p>

<p>“It contained a small handkerchief, some gold coins,
and a diamond ring. Oh, how it glittered!” she exclaimed,
with quiet enthusiasm. “I gasped with
amazement when I saw it. I bent my head nearer to
peer into the bag, and then&mdash;oh, what a strange feeling
came over me!”</p>

<p>“Explain,” said Chick. “Describe it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I can,” Miss Fielding replied.
“I never felt so before. I seemed to be losing myself,
so to speak, and everything suddenly grew dim.”</p>

<p>“Did you feel ill or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not at all. The sensation was only momentary,
as when one suddenly faints. Then all became
dark. I don’t know what I did or what followed.
I knew nothing more, sir, until I revived on a cot
in the hospital and saw the physician and the nurse
bending over me. That is all I know about it, sir, all
I can tell you.”</p>

<p>Chick had been watching her intently, and he was
sure that she had told the truth. It was a strange
story, nevertheless, a remarkable experience, and he
began to rack his brain for an explanation.</p>

<p>“I believe all you have said, Miss Fielding,” he assured
her. “Have you any idea what overcame you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said she earnestly. “Not the slightest
idea. It is terribly mysterious.”</p>

<p>“Did it occur immediately after you opened the
bag?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, almost immediately; surely within two
or three seconds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[85]</span></p>

<p>“When you bent nearer to look into the bag?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Had you removed the handkerchief?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. The gold coins and ring were on top
of it.”</p>

<p>“Had you detected any odor from it, that of perfumery
or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, sir, nothing,” Nellie interposed. “I would
have done so, perhaps, if there had been any, for I
held it quite near my face.”</p>

<p>“That is the very point,” said Chick, smiling. “I
now suspect that the handkerchief was impregnated
with some odorless, but very powerful drug, which instantly
affected you. Naturally, in your surprise, you
would have inhaled it freely, and I think that is how
you were so quickly overcome.”</p>

<p>“That may explain it,” Miss Fielding admitted.
“But it all was very, very strange.”</p>

<p>“Can you recall anything that immediately followed?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, absolutely nothing.”</p>

<p>“But you can tell me just where it occurred?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” Nellie nodded quickly. “It was on the
corner of Main and Maple Streets. There is an all-night
lunch cart nearly opposite. I remember seeing
it, and that is why I am sure of the precise location.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” said Chick, smiling again. “Now tell
me, Miss Fielding, why you asked for the leather bag
before leaving the hospital. You claimed to have
missed it.”</p>

<p>“I did, sir,” she readily admitted. “I suddenly
remembered it and thought I would take it and try to<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
find the owner. I did not think of its having been the
cause of my trouble.”</p>

<p>“But why did you not explain the circumstances to
Doctor Devoll and insist upon searching for the bag?
You afterward said you were not sure you had it.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, it suddenly occurred to me that I might
be suspected of stealing it,” Nellie explained, blushing
again. “That thought alarmed me, and I was anxious
only to leave the hospital and go home as quickly as
possible. That is why, too, I gave the physician a
false name and address. I wanted to wash my hands
of the whole affair and avoid any publicity.”</p>

<p>“Very good. I don’t much blame you,” Chick
laughed, with a nod of approval. “I guess you have
told me a straight story, Miss Fielding.”</p>

<p>“I have told you the truth, sir,” she said earnestly.
“I hope nothing more will&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, there is nothing for you to fear,” Chick hastened
to assure her. “Say nothing about it to others
or about me, and you probably will hear no more of it.
If you do learn anything more, however, write for me
to call and see you. A line to John Blaisdell, Wilton
House, will reach me.”</p>

<p>Miss Fielding promised to comply, and wrote the
name on a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>Chick said a few more words to reassure her, and
he then departed and hastened to the corner of Main
and Maple Streets, where the girl had so mysteriously
lost consciousness. He saw at a glance that the surroundings,
aside from the lunch cart a few rods away,
would have been favorable at midnight for the knavish
trick that he now was sure had been turned.</p>

<p>Crossing over, he found the proprietor of the lunch<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
cart alone, and he called him to the door, a shrewd,
keen-eyed Irish chap in the twenties.</p>

<p>“I’m looking into a job that was pulled off about
twelve o’clock night before last,” Chick informed him.
“Did you happen to see a girl standing alone on the
opposite corner about that time?”</p>

<p>“Faith, sir, I did,” nodded the other quickly. “I
was here at my door, sir, hoping to hook onto some
customers from the theater. The girl stopped under
the lamp and was looking at something.”</p>

<p>“That’s the one,” said Chick. “Do you know how
long she remained there?”</p>

<p>“Not more than a couple of minutes. Then a man
joined her and a motor cab showed up. They got
into it and rode away.”</p>

<p>“With the cabman?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Can you describe either man?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“Faith, I don’t think so,” was the reply. “I didn’t
notice them closely, not thinking of anything wrong.
Besides, the cabman didn’t leave his seat. The other
was about medium size, I’d say, and wore a dark suit.
I would not swear to it, but I think he had a dark
beard, too.”</p>

<p>“Quite likely,” Chick said dryly. “Do you know
from which direction he came?”</p>

<p>“Up the street, sir. I reckoned that he was following
the girl, and that she was waiting for him. That’s
how it struck me.”</p>

<p>“Did the cab come from the same direction?”</p>

<p>“It did. I supposed the man had called it.”</p>

<p>“Did the girl go with him willingly?”</p>

<p>“She sure did, sir, for all I could see. The man<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
took her arm and helped her in, and then they rode
away. That’s all there was to it.”</p>

<p>Chick saw that this man could tell him nothing more
definite, and he left him, to believe, as he had said,
that there was nothing more to it.</p>

<p>“All the same, by Jove, the mystery seems only the
deeper,” he said to himself while walking away. “Why
was Nellie Fielding, as well as three girls before her,
temporarily abducted and left unconscious in the hospital
grounds? Neither was subjected to any further
harm, any personal outrage, and robbery surely was
not the motive. What was it, then? What could be
gained? Why were such chances repeatedly taken?
There must have been something to gain, but I’ll be
hanged if I can fathom what. Deeper mystery is
right. There must be a big game or a most knavish
one, somewhere under the surface.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE ANGLE OF REFLECTION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Doctor David Devoll, whose will and word were
law in the Osgood Hospital, gazed intently at the
card brought in by his personal attendant. He was
seated at a broad, flat desk in the middle of his private
room, a sanctuary into which few would have dared
to intrude after having once offended in that way.</p>

<p>For of all the rules and regulations of this institution,
there was none more inflexible, none more rigorously
enforced, than that forbidding intrusion upon
the privacy of Doctor David Devoll.</p>

<p>And when, perchance, it was violated, which was
very, very seldom, the unfortunate offender had cause
to long remember that suavity and smoothness in a
man may sometimes serve only to hide, like the sleek
coat of a leopard, very sharp claws and merciless teeth.</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll rubbed the top of his bald head with
his slender hands, gazing at the card and muttering
the name inscribed on it.</p>

<p>“Blaisdell&mdash;John Blaisdell&mdash;I do not place him.
Written with a pen, eh? Do you know the man, Shannon?”</p>

<p>“Not from a side of leather.”</p>

<p>“Not even by sight?”</p>

<p>“Never laid eyes on him. He’s a new one to my
lamps.”</p>

<p>Shannon’s terse replies seemed to issue with husky
quietude from the uppermost depths of his throat.<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
They were neither refined nor respectful. They
smacked of closer relations than those of master and
servant, as also appeared in his confidential attitude
and air of assurance. For he was bowed over the
desk, with both hands spread upon it, a broad, compact,
muscular man of fifty, with the bullet head of a
pugilist and the strength of a bull. He was clad in
livery, nevertheless&mdash;a bottle-green jacket and trousers,
trimmed with black braid.</p>

<p>“He stated, you say, that he has private business
with me.” Doctor Devoll gazed up from the card
with a sinister gleam in his cold blue eyes.</p>

<p>“That’s what he said.”</p>

<p>“But not to what it relates?”</p>

<p>“Not he!” Shannon grinned. “He ducked my question,
as if it were a right swing. When I have private
business with a man, says he, I don’t confide it to his
servant. That was how he countered.”</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll’s thin lips took on a smile that did
not improve his facial expression, usually very agreeable
and benign. He said deliberately:</p>

<p>“You may show him in, Shannon. Wait. Don’t
let his business be too private, not too private, Shannon,”
he added significantly, pointing to a curtained
door. “Slip around there after admitting him and
wait until he goes. You may be needed.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do better than that. If needed, Dave, I’ll be&mdash;here!”</p>

<p>“Very good. Show him in.”</p>

<p>Shannon straightened up, smoothed his bottle-green
jacket with his palms, and stalked with stilty stiffness
through the opposite door, closing it after him.</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll reverted to the card.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[91]</span></p>

<p>“Written with a pen,” he repeated, his eyes squinted
and gleaming. “But not on one of our office blanks.
Most men have a printed card or engraved. Written
with a pen. One might rightly infer from that, perhaps,
that his name is not&mdash;Blaisdell.”</p>

<p>Obviously, Doctor Devoll was more than ordinarily
discerning.</p>

<p>Shannon had, in the meantime, returned to the man
waiting in the hospital office. He then had all the earmarks
of a well-trained butler, thoroughly conscious
of his dignified functions.</p>

<p>“Pardon the delay, sir,” he said sedately. “Doctor
Devoll was talking by telephone with a patient. He
will see you. This way, sir.”</p>

<p>Nick followed him through the main corridor, then
into a narrow diverging passageway, then down three
steps and through a second narrow entry, at the end
of which was the door of the physician’s private room.
Shannon knocked and then opened it.</p>

<p>“Mr. Blaisdell, sir,” he announced.</p>

<p>The detective entered and Doctor Devoll arose to
meet him, bowing and placing a chair.</p>

<p>“Take a seat, Mr. Blaisdell,” he said blandly. “I’m
sorry to have kept you waiting. I was busy with the
telephone.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” Nick replied. “I shall not take
much of your valuable time.”</p>

<p>He sat down while speaking, and his trained eyes
quickly took in most of the details of the spacious,
handsomely furnished room. Two windows overlooked
the rear grounds. Each was entirely covered
with an interior, painted wire screen, which precluded
observation from outside, but through which one<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
within could see plainly. There were roller shades
and shutters, also, that would insure privacy after the
lamps were lighted.</p>

<p>The detective saw at once that he was in a rear
room in the main building. He could see the broad
sweep of the rear lawn, the back street in the near distance,
a gravel path leading out to it through the park,
evidently from a near rear door. He no sooner was
seated, moreover, than he saw something else&mdash;which
would have been seen and appreciated by only one detective
in a million.</p>

<p>The broad, flat desk was between him and one of
the windows, the light from which struck the top of
the desk at an angle, causing a slight glare on its
smooth leather surface. Two spots that broke this
glare, however, apart from some books and papers
nearer the chair from which the physician had arisen,
instantly caught the detective’s eye.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the shape of them, nor
what had caused them. They were the broad outlines
of a man’s hands, outspread while he leaned over the
desk, and the moisture from which still lingered on
the smooth leather.</p>

<p>“By Jove, I’ve hit a pair of liars!” thought Nick instantly,
though his strong, clean-cut face did not
change by so much as a shadow. “That fellow in livery
was leaning over the desk, with both hands spread
on it, directly opposite the chair from which this doctor
arose. The dampness from them has not yet dried
from the leather, nor would it have been imparted to
it unless the hands were there for several moments.
That’s an unusual and remarkably confidential attitude
for a servant. The telephone is in one corner and<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
ten feet from the desk. I’ll wager, by Jove! that the
doctor was not using it, and that something else occasioned
the delay, possibly a conference concerning me
and my mission. Both lied about the telephone, as
sure as I’m a foot high, but for what reason?”</p>

<p>Obviously, of course, these shrewd deductions were
mere impressions that flashed very swiftly through the
detective’s mind, rather than a process of deliberate
reasoning. Naturally, too, they instantly gave rise to
new and somewhat startling suspicions, which, with
characteristic self-control, Carter was careful to conceal.</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll had pattered around his desk, in the
meantime, and was taking the chair from which he
had arisen.</p>

<p>“I am not busy just now, Mr. Blaisdell,” he said.
“I can give you what time you want. What’s the
trouble? You don’t look like a man afflicted with any
physical ailment.”</p>

<p>Nick laughed lightly and shook his head, sizing up
with augmented interest this bald, thin-featured,
smooth-spoken physician who, so singularly and unexpectedly,
had now incurred his distrust.</p>

<p>“No, nothing of the kind,” he replied. “If all men
were as strong and healthy as I am, Doctor Devoll,
those of your profession would find it hard sledding.”</p>

<p>“That is fortunate for you, at least,” smiled the
physician.</p>

<p>“My business with you relates to another matter,”
the detective added.</p>

<p>“Private business&mdash;or so my man informed me.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[94]</span></p>

<p>“Concerning what?” Doctor Devoll’s narrow eyes
took on a searching squint.</p>

<p>“I want to ask you about the girl who was found
unconscious in the hospital grounds late last night,”
Nick explained. “More precisely, I want your opinion
of her condition and the cause of it, as well as of
the three previous cases very closely resembling it.
It strikes me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“One moment, sir,” Doctor Devoll interrupted.
“Why are you specially interested in the case?”</p>

<p>“Is that material?” Nick inquired, smiling.</p>

<p>“Quite so. I am not in the habit of discussing my
cases with strangers. I want to know to whom I express
an opinion, and for what reason and by what
right it is asked.”</p>

<p>“Otherwise, Doctor Devoll, you do not express it?”
queried the detective, noting a subtle ring in the other’s
voice. “Is that what I am to infer?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.” Doctor Devoll nodded. “Reticence
would denote a covert motive on your part in seeking
my opinion. I would not stand for that for a moment.
I must be met halfway or I will not discuss a case
with any visitor.”</p>

<p>“That seems to be a consistent position, I’m sure,”
Carter admitted. “I will tell you, therefore, why I
am interested in this case. It was brought to my notice
by Chief Gleason, of the police department, at
whose request I am investigating it.”</p>

<p>“You are a detective, then.”</p>

<p>“Well, merely to that extent,” Nick allowed evasively.</p>

<p>“I see.” Doctor Devoll stroked his black frock coat<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
and drew up in his chair. “Let me ask you one more
question, Mr. Blaisdell.”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Why is an investigation thought to be necessary?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you consider it wise?”</p>

<p>“For the police to butt in?” Doctor Devoll said a
bit sharply. “I can’t say that I do.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“Why should they interfere? What was there in
either case that demands police investigation?” Doctor
Devoll curtly questioned. “A girl was overcome,
was addicted to a drug, or a dope of some kind, and
wandered into the hospital grounds. She was found
and brought in here. I revived her and she immediately
insisted upon going home. That’s all there was
to any one of the cases. Why, I repeat, do they require
police investigation?”</p>

<p>“I cannot conceive, Doctor Devoll, that you have
any personal objection to an investigation,” Nick remarked
dryly, smiling again.</p>

<p>A tinge of red leaped up in the physician’s cheeks.
A sharper gleam shot from his squinted eyes. He detected
a covert insinuation in his visitor’s tone. He
felt that he had said too much, perhaps, for he quickly
retorted:</p>

<p>“Not the slightest objection, Mr. Blaisdell, not the
slightest objection. I merely fail to see why an investigation
is necessary. There are hundreds of dope
fiends in every large city, but in none of them have the
police a very great interest. Why their activity, then,
in these cases? What do they suspect?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think that four such cases warrant suspicion?”
the detective blandly inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[96]</span></p>

<p>“Not more than the hundreds I have mentioned.”</p>

<p>“But all were found in the hospital grounds,” Carter
pointed out suggestively.</p>

<p>“What of that?” Doctor Devoll demanded. “A
coincidence. Nothing else. One may have been influenced
by having read of the others. There is no
accounting for the doings of a drug fiend.”</p>

<p>“There is some truth in that,” Nick admitted.</p>

<p>“Let it go at that, then,” said Doctor Devoll, with
a wave of his slender hands. “I wanted only to learn
your opinion, your grounds for suspicion. You now
are welcome to mine. I will answer any question you
care to ask.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the detective, who now was taking
a somewhat different course than he would have
shaped if he had detected nothing denoting duplicity
in the physician. “You think these girls were drug
fiends, do you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know positively,” Doctor Devoll said
quickly. “I am not sure that the coma in which I
found them was the cause of a drug. There is a possibility,
of course, that the cause was a temporary
atrophy of the cerebral nerves.”</p>

<p>“But you intimated to Sergeant Brady that they
were drugged,” Nick reminded him.</p>

<p>“That was and still is what I suspect, but I am
not sure of it,” Doctor Devoll retorted. “I had not
time to look deeply into either case. My duty was to
restore my patient, which I succeeded in doing, and
each of them then insisted upon departing and going
home.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you detain them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[97]</span></p>

<p>“I had no right to do so. One may leave here as
soon as able. This is not a police station.”</p>

<p>“But why didn’t you question them about their
habits, Doctor Devoll, and insist upon knowing their
names?” the detective asked more pointedly.</p>

<p>“I did so in the last case.”</p>

<p>“Why not in the others? It strikes me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop a moment,” Doctor Devoll interrupted, lurching
forward in his chair. “I run this institution, Mr.
Blaisdell, and I’m not going to be bothered in this way
nor have my conduct picked to pieces by the police.
When another case turns up, I would advise your
having her taken to headquarters. You then can call
another physician. Get him to restore her. He may
know more than I.</p>

<p>“You can hold the girl, charge her with something,
frame her up in any way you like, which is quite in a
line with police methods, and, perhaps, you can force
her to impart all the information you want. I know
no other way by which you can learn the truth.”</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll arose with the last, signifying that he
would not prolong the interview. Carter had let him
run on without interrupting, noting his impatience
and a more threatening shrillness in his voice. He
decided not to question him further. He arose and
took his hat, saying with ominous quietude:</p>

<p>“There is another way, Doctor Devoll, and I shall
find it. I’m going to dig out the whole truth, not only
in these cases, but also in the sudden mysterious death
of Gaston Todd. There is, I now feel sure, quite a
close relation between all of these cases and the many
mysterious robberies that have recently been committed
in Madison. I want the whole truth, Doctor<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
Devoll, and I’m out to get it. Take it from me&mdash;I’ll
find the way.”</p>

<p>“I wish you much success.” Doctor Devoll’s thin
lips took on a rather sardonic smile. “I wish you
much and speedy success, Mr. Blaisdell. This way, sir,
if you are going. Call again. I shall be interested
to know how you succeed and to learn the true inwardness
of these mysteries. Ah, here is my man. Show
Mr. Blaisdell the way, Shannon, if you please. Call
again, sir; call again.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I think it highly probable,” said Carter,
with singular dryness.</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll bowed, still smiling, and closed the
door, to which he had accompanied the detective.</p>

<p>Nick Carter followed Shannon out by the way he
had entered, departing without so much as a word to
the burly attendant. There was a suspicious gleam in
the latter’s eyes, however, while he watched the departing
detective through one of the office windows.
Turning abruptly, as if hit with a sudden idea, he
closed the office door and then called up the police
headquarters by telephone.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said he, with a voice very unlike his own.
“One of Carter’s assistants is talking from the Wilton
House. Do you know where I can find him?”</p>

<p>A sergeant answered, one who happened to know
of Carter’s relations with the chief, but upon whom
the above inquiry made no impression and was not
afterward recalled.</p>

<p>“I do not,” he replied. “He has not been here since
morning.”</p>

<p>Shannon hung up the receiver; then arose and hurried
back to rejoin the physician.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[99]</span></p>

<p>“I’m wise, Dave,” he announced, with an exultant
snarl. “I’ve nailed him.”</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll swung around from the fireplace,
near which he was standing.</p>

<p>“Wise to what?” he demanded. “Do you mean
that you know him?”</p>

<p>“You bet I know him. Brady, you remember, telephoned
to a man named Blaisdell last night, who is at
the Wilton House. It just struck me that Gleason has
employed outside detectives. There is just one crack
sleuth whom he most likely would want. I have
phoned to headquarters, saying I was his assistant and
asking if he was there. I was told that he was there
this morning. That does settle it. You have just
been talking, Dave, with the famous New York detective,
the worst ever&mdash;Nick Carter.”</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll started slightly and for a moment
appeared incredulous. Then his teeth met with a vicious
snap. His face changed as if he had been suddenly
turned to a devil incarnate.</p>

<p>“You are sure of it, Shannon, sure of it?” he questioned,
with a sibilant hiss.</p>

<p>“Dead sure, Dave,” Shannon insisted. “There’s
nothing to it.”</p>

<p>“Nick Carter, eh? The worst ever, eh?” Doctor
Devoll gave way to a mirthless, derisive laugh. “We’ll
see about that. We’ll see about that, Shannon. He
shall find that he has met one worthy of his steel, one
who will balk, thwart, and laugh at him. Or, if need
be, Shannon, who will wipe him from the face of the
earth!”</p>

<p>Shannon shrugged his broad shoulders and smiled
grimly. It was not the first time that he had heard<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
such sentiments as these, and seen that same gleam
and glitter in the eyes of the man confronting him,
eyes with a glare like that of madness.</p>

<p>“You will not quit, then?” he said inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Quit!” Doctor Devoll sneered scornfully. “Only
curs and cowards quit, Shannon, and throw up the
sponge. Sit down at my desk. Sit down and write
what I dictate. Your hand will never be suspected.”</p>

<p>Shannon obeyed him without a protest. He was
accustomed to yielding to this man, to obeying him
without question. He sat down at the desk, taking the
pen and paper which the physician provided. Half
an hour had passed when Doctor Devoll ended his
dictation and gave the other his instructions.</p>

<p>Shannon arose and went to change his livery for
street attire.</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll, with face still reflecting his vicious
sentiments, gazed intently at his desk for several moments.
Then he started abruptly, having decided what
course he would shape, and hurriedly opened a safe
in one corner, taking from it a small rubber mask,
which he quickly adjusted over his mouth and nostrils.
Then he took from an inner compartment&mdash;a small
leather bag.</p>

<p>Out of the latter he drew a crumpled handkerchief,
lady’s size, and hurriedly cast it with the bag into the
fireplace. A blue flame sprang up, hissing audibly,
denoting that the handkerchief was saturated with a
very volatile and inflammable substance of some kind.
The physician watched them burn, smiling sardonically;
then forced the charred remains deep among the
glowing embers.</p>

<p>“Nick Carter, eh?” he muttered, relocking the mask<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
in his safe. “He suspects me, does he? He’ll corner
me, will he? We shall see&mdash;we shall see!”</p>

<p>When Shannon returned, he had a disguise in his
hand, which he was placing temporarily in his pocket.</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll started up from his desk with two
sealed letters, which he had hurriedly written. He
gave them to his attendant, saying sharply, with eyes
gleaming again:</p>

<p>“This to Toby Monk. This to Tim Hurst. Be
wary when leaving the other, Shannon, both wary and
watchful. Nick Carter, eh? We shall see, Shannon,
we shall see!”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">NICK CARTER’S DEDUCTIONS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was six o’clock when Nick Carter returned to
the Wilton House. Daylight was deepening to dusk.
The last editions of the local newspapers were out,
and the shrill voices of juvenile venders could be
heard from all directions. The detective glanced at
the papers, which in headline luridness proclaimed:</p>

<p>“Leading Lawyer Suspected in Todd Murder!
Frank Paulding Arrested! Chief Gleason Sure of His
Man!”</p>

<p>Nick Carter smiled faintly, but with a more threatening
gleam and glitter deep down in his eyes, when
these varied cries of the newsboys reached his ears.
He bought a paper from one, thrusting it into his
pocket, and entered the hotel.</p>

<p>“Gleason has made good, all right,” he muttered
while seeking the elevator. “That will make it easier
for me, as well as all this, which is precisely what I
expected. But it’s up to me, by Jove! and must be
done quickly, or good night to my reputation.”</p>

<p>He referred to what he had overheard while threading
his way through the unusual throng in the hotel
office. There was much excitement and only one matter
under discussion&mdash;the alleged murder, the mystery
shrouding it, the strange death of the victim, and
divers opinions regarding the suspected man.</p>

<p>The detective went up to his suite, where, as he expected,
he found Chick and Patsy waiting for him, the
former eager to report what he had learned from<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
Nellie Fielding. It took him only a few moments,
and apparently, as Chick had reasoned, it seemed only
to deepen the mystery. It brought a look of grim satisfaction,
however, to the face of the listening detective.</p>

<p>“I cannot see that it sheds any light on the case,”
Chick added perplexedly.</p>

<p>“It does, Chick, nevertheless,” Carter said confidently.</p>

<p>“Does it dovetail with something you have discovered?”</p>

<p>“You may judge for yourself. I’ll tell you what
I saw and learned during my call on Doctor Devoll.”</p>

<p>He proceeded to do so, but the look of perplexity
still lingered on Chick’s face, and Patsy appeared dubiously
puzzled.</p>

<p>“It is somewhat significant, if you are right, chief,
that both Doctor Devoll and his man lied to you,”
Chick said thoughtfully. “But I don’t see that what
the physician said to you or the position he took cuts
any ice.”</p>

<p>“You don’t, eh?” returned Carter, smiling grimly.
“It cuts quite thick ice, Chick.”</p>

<p>“Why so? I don’t get you.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz, chief, nor do I,” put in Patsy. “What
do you mean? Come across with it.”</p>

<p>“First, a word about the girl, Nellie Fielding, and
what befell her,” said Carter. “It probably is precisely
what befell the others, and all were victims of
the same crook and his assistant. Just what game
he was playing and with what object remains to be
learned.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>“Wait a bit!” Carter cut in. “You’ll get me presently.
Nellie Fielding evidently told you the truth.
The mysterious bag was deftly slipped into her hand.
She did what the others did, when she could discover
no owner for it. She kept it until well away from the
crowd, then opened it to see what it contained. As
you have inferred, Chick, something in the bag, probably
that with which the handkerchief was saturated,
immediately overcame her. A very powerful and mysterious
gas may have been liberated from the bag, and
it naturally would have been inhaled by the girl when
she peered into it.”</p>

<p>“That seemed to me the most plausible theory,” said
Chick.</p>

<p>“It has become rather more than a theory,” Carter
replied. “I now am almost sure of it.”</p>

<p>“For other reasons?”</p>

<p>“Yes. To continue, it is safe to assume that the
girl was constantly watched. The moment she lost
herself, for she certainly lost consciousness to some
extent, at least, she was taken away by two men and
placed on the seat in the hospital grounds, then wholly
unconscious, where Policeman Donovan found her.”</p>

<p>“Barclay was right, then,” said Chick. “That was
the cab seen by the artist.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly.”</p>

<p>“But why was the girl taken into the hospital
grounds?”</p>

<p>“That’s one point,” said Carter. “So that, when
discovered, she would surely be taken into the hospital&mdash;where
Doctor Devoll would be the one to treat
her.”</p>

<p>“You think&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[105]</span></p>

<p>“One moment. Don’t force me ahead of my story.
These circumstances require careful and thorough
analysis.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, then.”</p>

<p>“Bear in mind that Doctor Devoll treated all four
of these cases. He treated them successfully. They
did not appear to baffle him, or even mystify him, I
suspect. Bear in mind, too, that he did not detain the
girls, did not question them closely, or seek to learn
their names, even, with the exception of Nellie Fielding.
Remember, too, that the mysterious leather bag,
which Sergeant Brady knows was taken into the wardroom,
could not be found. Take it from me&mdash;Doctor
Devoll was the one who got away with it.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! all that does appear deucedly suspicious,”
Chick now declared. “It may explain, too, Devoll’s
attitude this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, chief, is right,” cried Patsy. “Gee! things
are beginning to brighten up.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go a step farther,” Carter continued. “All
of the mysterious robberies and holdups during the
past three months, which we were called here to investigate,
were of a very similar character, and all
bore a striking likeness to what befell Nellie Fielding.
The victims invariably were found unconscious
after the crime, though afterward were quite easily
restored, and all told the same story&mdash;that of being
confronted by a person who, in some mysterious way,
caused them to immediately lose consciousness and
then deliberately robbed them.”</p>

<p>“You think all of these cases, then, were the work
of the same gang of crooks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[106]</span></p>

<p>“That is precisely what I think,” Carter said more
forcibly. “I am convinced of it by their similarity and
the mysterious means employed, which show plainly
that the knave back of the whole business is an exceedingly
capable and well-informed rascal. He must
be an expert in drugs, or have discovered some chemical
compound the quality and effect of which are not
known by other physicians and scientists.”</p>

<p>“Do you suspect that Doctor Devoll is the criminal?”
Chick inquired.</p>

<p>“I do not like his looks, his conduct in these cases,
or the position he took when I questioned him.”</p>

<p>“But it seems really improbable that a man of his
prominence and profession would be engaged in such
knavery,” Chick argued.</p>

<p>“That’s what every one would say, and it would
be deucedly difficult to convince them of his guilt,”
Carter replied. “That could be done only by producing
positive evidence of it.”</p>

<p>“Very true.”</p>

<p>“It may be equally difficult to find that evidence,”
Carter added. “It must be found, nevertheless, assuming
that I am right. In no other way can we
make good.”</p>

<p>“True again,” Chick admitted.</p>

<p>“I was very careful, therefore, not to betray that
I suspected him. I pretended to swallow all that he
handed out, and let it go at that. One word more,
now, and I will have covered all of the ground. That
relates to the Todd murder.”</p>

<p>“What about it?”</p>

<p>“The mystery is as to how and with what means it<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
was committed. You know what the autopsy revealed&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Next to nothing,” put in Patsy.</p>

<p>“That’s the very point,” said Nick. “Chemical tests
may reveal the presence of poison. Doctor Marvin
thinks, however, and I am of the same opinion, that
Todd was killed with some kind of poisonous gas.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! that seems next to impossible,” Chick
declared. “Consider the time, the public place, and all
of the circumstances. Todd was telephoned to come
to the Waldmere Chambers and wait in the corridor.
It was done at a moment’s notice, so to speak, with a
view to incriminating Frank Paulding, if your suspicions
are correct. How in thunder could a poisonous
gas be administered to a man under such conditions?”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! it does look like an utter impossibility,
chief,” said Patsy.</p>

<p>“Or the work of an exceedingly bold and accomplished
crook, the same crook who committed these
other mysterious crimes,” Carter insisted. “Their
similarity convinces me, as I have said, that all were
the work of the same man and same gang.”</p>

<p>“That much does seem probable,” Chick allowed.
“There is no getting around it.”</p>

<p>“And it’s up to us to get after them and find the
evidence needed to identify and convict them,” Carter
said flatly. “Now, Patsy, what have you learned?
Is there any man who might properly term himself
Todd’s running mate? That’s what the telephone girl
heard.”</p>

<p>“I have not been able to find one, chief,” Patsy reported.<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
“There seems to be no man with whom he
was specially friendly.”</p>

<p>“Nor any tenant in the Waldmere Chambers whom
he was in the habit of visiting?”</p>

<p>“Not that I could learn,” Patsy again replied in the
negative. “I questioned the janitor and several others.
Not one of them had ever seen Todd in the building.
So far as I could learn, chief, he never visited the
Waldmere Chambers.”</p>

<p>“All the more reason, then, for suspecting that he
was lured there that day only to be killed.”</p>

<p>“But I have learned one fact, chief,” Patsy added.</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Todd had a suite here in the Wilton House for the
past two years. About a month ago, however, he
changed his quarters to the Studley. That is an
apartment house in Dale Street. His suite is on the
second floor.”</p>

<p>“He may have had some secret motive for the
change,” Carter said thoughtfully. “The hotel may
have been too public a place for something in which
he was secretly engaged. We must look into that. No
investigation in his apartments has yet been made.”</p>

<p>“We had better make one, then,” Chick suggested.</p>

<p>“I was coming to that. You go there this evening
and see what you can find. Search for letters, papers,
or anything that might shed a ray of light on
the case.”</p>

<p>“Leave it to me,” Chick nodded. “I’ll go through
his suite with a fine-tooth comb.”</p>

<p>“Accomplish it secretly, however, if possible,” Carter
quickly directed. “I don’t want our doings and
designs suspected by the miscreants back of this<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
knavery. I want to keep them in the dark as long
as possible.”</p>

<p>“Leave it to me. I’ll turn the trick without being
seen,” Chick predicted confidently.</p>

<p>“In the meantime, Patsy, you go at once to the
Osgood Hospital and watch for any move by Doctor
Devoll,” said Nick, abruptly turning to him. “My
visit may, if my suspicions are warranted, alarm him
into taking steps that would clinch them. Shadow
him, if he goes out, and watch him constantly.”</p>

<p>“Enough said, chief,” cried Patsy, springing up to
get his hat. “He’ll be a good one, indeed, if he gets
by me with a move of any kind. I’ll soon have my
lamps on him.”</p>

<p>Patsy did not wait for an answer. He was out
and away almost as soon as the last was said.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE MAN WITH A MASK.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Nick Carter met with a surprise when he went down
to dine with Chick, after the hurried departure of
Patsy Garvan. The office clerk, seeing them going
to the dining room, took a letter from a rack and
beckoned to the detective, saying, when he approached:</p>

<p>“This appears to be for you, Mr. Blaisdell.”</p>

<p>Nick took it and glanced at the pen-written address&mdash;Mr.
John Blaisdell, Wilton House.</p>

<p>He saw that it was not stamped, however, and
wondered who had left a letter for him, instead of
seeking a personal interview. Much more to his surprise,
upon removing the inclosed sheet, he found that
it bore no signature and was addressed, not fictitiously,
but to&mdash;Mr. Nicholas Carter.</p>

<p>“What’s the meaning of this?” he muttered, frowning.
“Has it leaked out that I am in Madison?”</p>

<p>He lingered in the office and read the letter, while
Chick approached and joined him, noting his ominous
expression. For the letter read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Nicholas Carter</span>: You may fool others with
a false name, but not the writer. He is not so easily
blinded. Your identity is known, also your mission,
but you are barking up the wrong tree and are booked
for failure. You will make the mistake of your life,
a fatal mistake, if you remain here and persist in the
work you have undertaken. It will cost you what
man holds most dear&mdash;your life.</p>

<p>“I am very well aware, Carter, that you are not<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
easily influenced by threats, and ordinarily ignore
them. I want to impress it upon you, therefore, that
I am not an ordinary person, and that I invariably do
what I threaten.</p>

<p>“You will doubt my ability to do so. Your abnormal
bump of conceit will cause you to think you
can protect yourself and avert your impending fate.
Disabuse yourself of that idea. You cannot possibly
escape me.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, Carter, I do not wish to wipe
you off the map unless you force me to do so. Don’t
make it imperative. Don’t fly into the face of fate.
Your safety lies in returning to New York and minding
your own business. Madison is too small for
both of us.</p>

<p>“Lest you underestimate your danger and disregard
this warning, however, and that I may be spared needless
bloodshed, if possible, I will try to convince you
that I am right, that I am vastly your superior, and
that I hold your life in my hand. You are said to be
a past master of the art of detecting and preventing
crime.</p>

<p>“On Thursday evening next an elaborate reception
and ball are to be held by the National Guards. Mrs.
Mortimer Thurlow will be among the guests. She is
very wealthy. She owns a superb rope of pearls. It
is worth eighty thousand dollars. She will wear it
that evening.</p>

<p>“I am going to steal it.</p>

<p>“I invite you to prevent me.</p>

<p>“If you succeed, you will have convinced me that
you are capable of guarding yourself from the fate I
have threatened.</p>

<p>“If you fail&mdash;you should be wise enough to realize
your peril and take my advice. I repeat it. Lose not
a moment in leaving Madison&mdash;or you will return to
New York in a coffin.”</p></div>

<p>Nick Carter’s brows knitted closer while he read this<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
threatening letter. He had turned so that Chick might
also read it, and the latter muttered, when both had
finished:</p>

<p>“Great guns! Who the devil wrote that?”</p>

<p>“It comes suspiciously soon after my call on Doctor
Devoll,” Nick said pointedly.</p>

<p>“Do you think he sent it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, of course, nor do I care.”</p>

<p>“It’s an infernal bluff.”</p>

<p>“Less a bluff than you suppose,” corrected Carter,
a bit grimly. “The writer means what he says.”</p>

<p>“That he will kill you?”</p>

<p>“If I give him a chance or don’t kill him.”</p>

<p>“You will ignore it, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And accept his challenge&mdash;surely!” Nick cut in.
“Wait one moment. I want to question Burton.”</p>

<p>They had remained near the office inclosure, to
which he now turned and called the clerk, asking
quietly:</p>

<p>“Who brought this letter, Mr. Burton? I see it is
not stamped.”</p>

<p>Burton laughed a bit oddly and shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Mr. Blaisdell,” he replied. “I found
it on the cigar case. I was somewhat mystified when
I saw it, for I had sold two men some cigars only a
moment before, and the letter was not there.”</p>

<p>“One of them left it there, perhaps,” Nick suggested,
intending to get a description of the men, in
that case.</p>

<p>“Impossible.” Burton spoke decidedly. “They
walked away before I closed the show case, and I saw
them leaving the house.”</p>

<p>“Did you see any one else near the show case?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[113]</span></p>

<p>“Not a person. I discovered the letter, nevertheless,
within a couple of minutes.”</p>

<p>“How long ago?”</p>

<p>“Not more than five minutes. I was intending to
send the letter up to your room. I hope the delay
is of no consequence,” Burton added.</p>

<p>“None whatever,” Carter assured him. “Come,
Chick, we’ll go in to dinner.”</p>

<p>“It’s plain enough that some one slipped in here
and seized an opportunity to leave the letter without
being seen,” Chick remarked.</p>

<p>“That’s about the size of it.”</p>

<p>“Will you do anything more about it?”</p>

<p>“Not at present.”</p>

<p>“Or change your plans?”</p>

<p>“Not an iota,” said Carter decidedly. “I am not
to be intimidated by threats. I may decide, however,
to attend the ball of the National Guards. If Mrs.
Mortimer Thurlow wears her rope of pearls, and the
writer of this letter attempts to steal it, he will end
with having it stuffed down his knavish throat. Vastly
my superior, eh? We’ll see about that.”</p>

<p>The detective thrust the threatening letter into his
pocket with the last, obviously averse to further discussing
it, and the subject was abruptly dropped.</p>

<p>None could have sized up the letter more correctly
or more keenly have realized its full significance.
Carter knew that his identity had been discovered by
the very crooks he was seeking, by the evil genius directing
them, in spite of his precautions to prevent it.
He knew that a ball had been set rolling which, urged
on by the mysterious criminal forces back of it, would
tax his utmost powers to successfully oppose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<p>It was about eight o’clock when Chick left the hotel,
suitably clad and well equipped for the stealthy work
assigned him. A brisk walk of about ten minutes took
him to Dale Street, in a desirable residential section,
and presently the lofty brick walls and numerous
lighted windows of the Studley, a somewhat exclusive
apartment house, loomed up on the opposite side.</p>

<p>He paused and viewed it briefly, noting that a narrow
court flanked one end of the building. He saw
that there was no public office, also that the broad,
main entrance and vestibule were brightly lighted.</p>

<p>“A suite on the second floor,” he said to himself.
“The windows don’t appeal to me. It ought not to
be very difficult to get into an unoccupied suite without
being seen. I believe it can be more easily done
from within than without. I’ll have a look.”</p>

<p>Crossing over, he entered the vestibule and consulted
the tiny placards under the numerous electric
bells, on one of which he presently found the number
of Todd’s suite. At the same moment he heard the
heavy inner door opened, and two fashionably clad
women came out.</p>

<p>“Pardon!” Chick approached them, instantly seizing
the opportunity presented. “If you will be so
kind, it will save me from using my key.”</p>

<p>“Certainly.” One of the women smiled, while she
prevented the door from closing.</p>

<p>The other eyed Chick a bit sharply, but he bowed
and murmured a word of thanks; then passed both
and entered, as complacently as if he owned the house.</p>

<p>“Very opportune,” he muttered dryly. “They
would think me a crook, all right, if they were to see
the key I intended to use. Without having seen it, in<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
fact, one appeared to have a vague impression that I
had no legitimate business here. I must contrive to
avoid other eyes.”</p>

<p>He had closed the door and was gazing up a broad,
dimly lighted stairway while indulging in these reflections.
He could hear no sound from the corridor of
the second floor. He stole up noiselessly and found
it deserted.</p>

<p>Glancing at the numbers on the nearest doors, he
quickly learned in which direction he must turn, and
he brought up within a minute at the door he was seeking&mdash;that
of the suite lately occupied by the murdered
man. It adjoined a diverging corridor, and its windows
overlooked the narrow court mentioned.</p>

<p>In the meantime, for so fate sometimes brings opposing
forces together, and often with disastrous results,
a man moving with the stealth of an evil shadow,
which any chance observer would surely have thought
him, had entered the narrow court and paused under
one of the several small platforms some ten feet above
the ground, each the base of a rise of iron stairs forming
a fire escape.</p>

<p>This man was clad from head to foot in black. It
seemed to mingle with the almost ebon gloom in the
court. He lingered only briefly. He quickly fastened
a black mask on his bearded face; then took a coiled
rope from under his coat. He cast it deftly around a
corner standard of the platform railing, up both
lengths of which he then drew himself, with the wiry
strength and agility of an ape. Kneeling on the platform,
he quickly drew up the rope and laid it aside;
then turned to crouch with a thin strip of steel at the
near window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[116]</span></p>

<p>It was at precisely the same moment that Chick
Carter, alone in the corridor, set to work with a picklock
to open the door of the suite. It took him about
a minute. The bolt of the lock was shot back with a
sharp, metallic sound&mdash;just as the fastening of the
window was forced aside with an audible snap.</p>

<p>Each sound was mingled with the other. Each
stealthy intruder heard only that which he had caused.
The window was noiselessly raised, moreover, just as
Chick entered and quietly closed the door.</p>

<p>He had stepped into a handsomely furnished parlor.
The other had entered a dining room. Between
the two rooms was an open door, with a drawn portière.
The feet of both men fell noiselessly on the
carpets and rugs.</p>

<p>Chick moved toward the middle of the room and
took out his electric lamp. Its beam of light leaped
outward&mdash;just as the portière was drawn and a second
beam of light appeared.</p>

<p>The two lenses were illumined at the same moment;
in fact, confronting one another like two startled, suddenly
opened eyes, with a glare that completely dispelled
the gloom.</p>

<p>Two more astonished men seldom met. For an instant
the sudden glare blinded both.</p>

<p>Chick’s first thought was that he had flashed the
light upon a panel mirror, reflecting it and himself.
On the instant, however, he saw the door, the black-clad
figure, the masked face and the glittering eyes
gleaming through it.</p>

<p>“Great guns!” he gasped involuntarily. “Who are
you?”</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[117]</span></p>

<p>The question was echoed with icy composure by the
man backed by the swaying portière. His voice came
with a sinister, metallic ring through his black mask.
He did not stir from his position or move foot or
finger.</p>

<p>Chick watched him to be sure of it. If a gun was to
be drawn, he was resolved to be the first to draw it.
He kept the glare of his searchlight on him, distinctly
revealing him, while the masked unknown used his
with like effect, but neither reached for a weapon. It
impressed Chick as one of the most singular and sensational
situations in which he had ever figured with
a solitary man.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” demanded the other.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t answer my question.”</p>

<p>“Nor have you answered mine.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to answer yours,” Chick said sternly.</p>

<p>“Nor I yours,” the masked man retorted coldly.</p>

<p>Chick felt almost inclined to laugh. He would have
done so, if the case engaging him had been a less serious
one, his mission less important, and with no occasion
to conceal his visit. He frowned, instead, however,
and shaped another course.</p>

<p>“You’d better change your mind,” he advised. “If
you don’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” snapped the “mask.” “Don’t you reach
for a gun. I can pull one as quickly as you and shoot
as straight. You keep your empty hand in sight or
you’ll be a dead one.”</p>

<p>“You do the same, then,” Chick said sharply.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m doing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>“Watch your step, then, and see that you don’t slip.”</p>

<p>“I’ll watch you, all right. You can bet on that.”</p>

<p>“You talk like a crook,” said Chick tentatively.</p>

<p>“You’ve got nothing on me in that respect,” the
mask retorted dryly. “You sneaked in here like a
thief.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not a thief&mdash;nor are you.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?”</p>

<p>“Not of the ordinary type. I’m hit with the truth.”</p>

<p>“That beats being hit with a club. What’s the big
idea?”</p>

<p>“I know, now, why you are here.”</p>

<p>“Solomon had nothing on you, then.”</p>

<p>“Not much.”</p>

<p>“Come on with it. What’s the brainy hunch?”</p>

<p>“You are one of the gang that killed Gaston Todd,”
Chick again said sternly, and the shot was not entirely
a random one. “You have come here to search
his rooms, and to see whether he has left evidence
that might expose you. You are here to find it and
get away with it.”</p>

<p>“You’re a real Willie Wisewinker,” the masked man
said with a sneer, and a threatening hiss crept into his
voice. “But you have got nothing on me. I know
you, too, all right. You are one of the Nick Carter
bunch, out to cut a wide swath in Madison, if your
tools don’t go dull. You state only your own mission.
You are here to search for evidence, hoping
to find and get away with it unsuspected&mdash;but you
have slipped a cog. You’ll not search for it, much less
get it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I will,” said Chick, who now had decided
how he best could end the situation and quietly accomplish<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
his object. “I’m going to get it, all right&mdash;and
get you.”</p>

<p>“Get me, eh?” The masked man laughed icily.
“You have as good a chance of getting me as a hailstone
would have on a red-hot stove.”</p>

<p>“That so?”</p>

<p>“I know so.”</p>

<p>“Why so confident?” Chick was edging nearer the
man by imperceptible degrees. “You must have pals
in the next room.”</p>

<p>“No, no pals,” sneered the other. “I don’t need
any.”</p>

<p>“You’re game to play a lone hand, eh?”</p>

<p>“Bet you! I’m the gamest ever.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I shall get you.”</p>

<p>“Not much! You have not a look in, not even the
ghost of a chance. You have not&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I? We’ll see.”</p>

<p>Scarce six feet divided the two men, and Chick had
steadied himself for a lightninglike leap. He felt sure
that he could quickly overcome the unknown man, despite
his brazen assurance, if he could grapple with
him before a revolver could be drawn, the discharge
of which he wished to prevent, knowing it would
alarm the house and be contrary to his chief’s instructions.</p>

<p>He leaped while he spoke, and covered the distance
with a single bound, dropping his searchlight.</p>

<p>The masked man dropped his, venting a wolfish
snarl, and on the instant the two men were grappling
in close embrace in the almost inky darkness.</p>

<p>Chick aimed to seize and confine both arms of his
antagonist, but in the sudden gloom he missed them.<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
The masked man had instantly raised both above his
head, and the detective’s muscular arms closed only
around his black-clad figure.</p>

<p>It was a lithe, wiry figure, one that Chick felt sure
he could crush and bend at will in his viselike embrace.
Contrary to what he expected, however, and which he
lurched to one side to avoid, no blow was dealt, no fist
fell upon his head, no fierce fingers sought his throat.</p>

<p>Instead, the hands of the masked man dropped
quickly and found those of the detective.</p>

<p>Then Chick felt a wire touch each wrist. Instantly
ten million needles seemed to have been thrust full
length into him. He tingled from head to foot with
excruciating pain. His every muscle relaxed as if palsied.
He gasped, tried vainly to shriek, and then the
darkness of the room was turned to that of utter oblivion&mdash;and
the masked man dropped him, as inert
as a bag of sand, on the carpeted floor.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">A MARATHON PURSUIT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Patsy Garvan arrived at the Osgood Hospital soon
after six o’clock that evening, more than two hours
before Chick encountered the masked man in Gaston
Todd’s apartments.</p>

<p>It then was dark, the sky clouded, with no stars
to reveal his stealthy movements to chance observers.
Only the scattered street lamps and the numerous
lighted windows of the great building, with those of
a few more distant dwellings, relieved the prevailing
gloom. It was even darker in the deserted grounds,
and Patsy took advantage of the trees and shrubbery,
entering the extensive estate near one corner, and
stealing quickly around the west wing toward a rear
part of the main building in which the private room
of Doctor David Devoll was located.</p>

<p>Patsy knew from Carter’s description, nevertheless,
where to find him, and he presently paused near
the rear door and the gravel walk leading out to the
back street.</p>

<p>“I must find out, to begin with, whether the blooming
sawbones is here,” he said to himself. “There are
the two windows of his room, all right, but there’s no
sign of a light. It looks very much as if he were
absent.”</p>

<p>Hugging the wall, and stealing closer, nevertheless,
he cautiously crouched under the nearer of the two
windows and tried to peer into the room. He then<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
found that the roller shade was lowered and an interior
shutter carefully closed, but through a chink
below them he could see the reflection of a dim light
on the varnished sill.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! he makes dead sure that no outsider
can see what’s doing in there,” thought Patsy. “He
may be in some other part of the hospital, since only
a dim light is burning. I’ll have to stick round till
I can get an eye on him.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, Patsy had arrived
there in the nick of time. The light in the room was
suddenly extinguished. Half a minute later the sound
of a turning knob, that of the rear door, broke the
outside stillness, and, as quick as a flash, Patsy dropped
flat on the ground close to the building.</p>

<p>He scarce had taken this precaution when the door
was opened and the physician came out. Though
Patsy never had seen him, Nick Carter had described
him carefully and there was no mistaking him. His
slender figure, invariably clad in a black frock coat,
which accentuated his leanness, was one very easily
identified. His smooth-shaven face was dimly discernible
through the darkness, while a considerable portion
of his bald, white skull could be seen in vivid
contrast under his tall, black hat.</p>

<p>“Gee! I’m playing lucky, after all,” thought Patsy,
cautiously watching him. “That’s my man, all right,
and he’s bound off. The chief was right in thinking
he would make a move of some kind.”</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll had paused to lock the door with a
key taken from his pocket. He did not so much as
glance toward the window under which Patsy was
lying, as flat as he could make himself on the damp<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
greensward. With his head and shoulders thrust forward
and his hands clasped behind him, an habitual
attitude when he was walking, Doctor Devoll proceeded
down the gravel walk toward the rear gate.</p>

<p>At that moment, too, Patsy caught sight of an approaching
motor car in the back street. Its lamps
shone through the trees, and he could see that it was
slowing down to stop at the gate.</p>

<p>“By Jove! I may not be as lucky as I thought,”
he muttered apprehensively. “If he leaves in that car
it will be a racking stunt for me to keep track of it.
I’ll make a bid to do so, all the same.”</p>

<p>Rising noiselessly, he now darted after the physician,
stealing from tree to tree, and seeking a point
from which he could get the license number of the
car, and also a look at its driver. He saw him quite
plainly a moment later, a powerful man wearing a
slouch hat and with the collar of his overcoat turned
up, partly hiding his face, a face that immediately increased
Patsy’s suspicion.</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll paused and said a few words to him;
then entered the car and disappeared, for its leather
curtains were on and completely hid the interior. Then
the chauffeur threw in the clutch and the car moved
away.</p>

<p>Patsy Garvan appreciated the difficulties confronting
him, but he did not let them daunt him. Running
diagonally across the gloomy grounds, he vaulted the
low iron fence immediately after the car had passed
that point, so near that he could easily read the rear
number plate. He fixed the number in his mind; then
darted stealthily after the car, which was entering the<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
narrow court through which Chick had passed that
morning.</p>

<p>Sprinting after it at top speed, though at a discreet
distance behind and in the deeper gloom near the buildings,
Patsy followed the car into Belmont Street and
saw that it had turned toward a more brightly lighted
business section in the distance. He could see a passing
trolley car, also several slowly moving wagons,
all of which was somewhat encouraging.</p>

<p>“They’ll have to slow down in that quarter,” he
muttered, already breathing hard from his exertions.
“That must be Main Street. It’s just the time when
the business thoroughfares are blocked with homeward-bound
teams. I may be able, after all, to keep
my quarry in sight. I must contrive in some way to
find out where this baldheaded suspect is going.”</p>

<p>It appeared like a hopeless pursuit, nevertheless,
for the motor car was speeding much more rapidly
through Belmont Street and leaving Patsy farther and
farther behind, in spite of his utmost exertions. Suddenly,
too, it turned down a street running parallel
with Main Street, evidently seeking a less-congested
way.</p>

<p>Patsy rushed on all the while, hoping to arrive at
the corner in time to keep the car in view, but he was
booked for failure. He paused, panting for breath,
and gazed vainly up and down the street. The only
vehicle to be seen was an approaching wagon nearly
a block away. Sprinting on to meet it, determined not
to be thwarted, Patsy shouted to the driver:</p>

<p>“Did a motor car pass you half a minute ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried the teamster. “Some one stolen it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Patsy took the quickest and surest way<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
to get the information he wanted. “Which way did
it go?”</p>

<p>“Through the next street to the right, toward Main
Street. You’ll have to fly, kid, to catch it.”</p>

<p>Patsy rushed on again, scarce waiting for the last,
but again he was marked for failure. He arrived at
the corner too late to see the car. Only the moving
people and vehicles in the electric glare in Main Street,
then only a block away, met his anxious gaze.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep on, by thunder!” he muttered, instantly
resuming the pursuit. “It may have been held up for
a moment. It must have turned to the left, too, or it
would have gone direct if intending to cross Main
Street. I’ll not quit, by gracious! while there’s a
ghost of a chance to overtake it.”</p>

<p>Patsy’s grit was good, but his quest proved vain
again, and he had no alternative but to end the futile
pursuit. He gazed with bitter disappointment up and
down the broad thoroughfare, still walking briskly
in the direction in which he knew the motor car had
gone, and, though he was not then aware of it, he
presently came to a crosstown street and trolley line
within a stone’s throw of the Waldmere Chambers.</p>

<p>Then, as he was about to return to the hotel to report
to his chief, the gloom of disappointment was
suddenly dispelled. The motor car was passing rapidly
through the crosstown street. There was no mistaking
it&mdash;the same number plate, the same muffled
driver, the same closely curtained tonneau, yet in
which Patsy caught a mere momentary glimpse of a
solitary figure.</p>

<p>“Holy smoke! I’m in luck again,” he said to himself,
with a thrill of elation. “The doctor must have<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
stopped somewhere and now is off in a new direction.
This looks like soft walking, for fair, if they will only
follow the trolley line.”</p>

<p>An electric car going in the same direction was passing,
and Patsy quickly boarded it, joining the motorman
on the front platform. Slipping him a bank note,
he said confidentially:</p>

<p>“Don’t ask any questions, but help me to keep that
motor car in sight. Do you get me?”</p>

<p>The motorman glanced at him with a look of surprise;
then thrust the bank note into his pocket and
grinned.</p>

<p>“Sure I get you,” he replied. “No questions, eh?
That’s good enough for me, though they do say money
talks. I’ll do the best I can for you.”</p>

<p>The automobile then was fifty yards in advance, but
the trolley car was unobstructed and rapidly gaining
speed through a street running straight toward an
outskirt of the city.</p>

<p>“Good for you,” replied Patsy. “Only a mutt would
expect more.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep it in sight, all right, unless I get the bell
too often. But we’re not carrying many this trip.”</p>

<p>“Where do you run?”</p>

<p>“To Ashville, six miles from here. But we hit the
suburbs soon; then can cut loose, if necessary. Do
you know where the buzz wagon is going?”</p>

<p>“If I did, I would not bother you,” smiled Patsy.
“I have reasons for wanting to find out, if possible.
Did you see the driver when he slipped in ahead of
you?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice him.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know who owns the car, then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[127]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t, but you can find out from the number.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got that in my head, all right,” Patsy nodded.
“I’ll look him up later.”</p>

<p>The motorman glanced at him again, and wondered
at his interest in a car and persons whom he
did not know or even their destination. He kept the
trolley car moving rapidly, nevertheless, and, in spite
of an occasional stop to drop or pick up passengers,
he lost but little on the somber black touring car, the
tail light of which gleamed like a sanguinary eye
through the gloom in the near distance.</p>

<p>A mile run took them into the suburbs, beyond
which was a stretch of almost open country, and Patsy
then had the satisfaction of seeing that the trolley
car was gaining on the other.</p>

<p>Through this open country and into a belt of woods
the trolley car boomed on, and when nearly three
miles out it sped over the brow of a hill, and Patsy
quickly saw the lights of scattered dwellings amid
clumps of trees in the distance.</p>

<p>“What place is that?” he inquired of the motorman.</p>

<p>“Only a small settlement. There’s a stone quarry
over the hill on the left, and the workmen live in
those houses. That one off to the right is in a side
road running to Lakeville, where there’s pretty good
fishing and gunning in the season. It’s a road house
run by a man named Leary. I guess that’s where your
buzz wagon is going. It’s taking that road.”</p>

<p>Patsy had an eye on it all the while, and saw that
the time had come for him to leave the trolley car. He
thanked the motorman again; then added:</p>

<p>“Slow down when near that road and let me drop<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
off without stopping. I don’t want a certain party to
hear the car stop. He might think he had been followed.”</p>

<p>“I’m on,” said the motorman, laughing. “You
know your business, all right.”</p>

<p>“I ought to,” smiled Patsy. “I was tutored by the
best in the business.”</p>

<p>“I guess not,” said the motorman incredulously.
“There’s only one best&mdash;Nick Carter.”</p>

<p>“So I have heard.”</p>

<p>“Now’s your chance. So long, and good luck.”</p>

<p>Patsy slipped through the folding door and sprang
down in the road, then darted to the shelter of a wall,
while the trolley car again sped on and presently
crossed the diverging road and approached the settlement
beyond it.</p>

<p>A hundred yards to the right the lights of the road
house could be seen through the trees, also the brighter
glare from the motor car, then slowly approaching it.</p>

<p>Patsy leaped over the wall; then hurried across a
strip of meadowland, quickly reaching a point from
which, sheltered by some shrubbery, he could plainly
see the broad driveway and front veranda of the old
and somewhat weather-beaten house.</p>

<p>The automobile had stopped near the rise of steps.
The chauffeur was springing down to open the door.
Patsy could see him distinctly in the light from the
deserted veranda.</p>

<p>“This bald-headed doctor may have legitimate business
out here,” he muttered, frowning grimly at the
mere thought of it and the possibility that his own
desperate efforts might prove futile. “If the chief’s
suspicions have feet to stand on, however, it’s a thousand<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
to one that Doctor Devoll’s mission is a very different
and probably a very lawless one. It’s up to me
to clinch it and find out just what’s doing. If he’s
here to confer with others, or frame up a job, I’ll
find some way to overhear him&mdash;&mdash;Thundering guns!
Am I in wrong, in dead wrong, after all?”</p>

<p>Patsy felt a chill of disappointment and his heart
sank like lead. The door of the motor car had been
opened. The solitary occupant, and Patsy could
plainly see there was no other, was stepping down
upon the driveway. He was an elderly man with gray
hair and beard, with a compact, apparently muscular
figure, clad in a plaid woolen suit and soft felt hat&mdash;utterly
unlike the long frock coat and tall black hat
of the suspected physician.</p>

<p>“In wrong, in dead wrong!” Patsy repeated, quite
crushed with sudden dismay. “That’s not my quarry&mdash;not
Doctor Devoll. He’s too straight, too erect,
too square and stocky, for Doctor Devoll. I’ve gone
lame, for fair, as lame as an army mule. That chauffeur
must have dropped the physician and picked up
another passenger.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">PROFESSOR KARL GRAFF.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Patsy Garvan’s disappointment was as deep and bitter
as one could imagine. He scarce could contain it,
in fact, and his first impulse was to bolt from his concealment
and demand of the chauffeur where he had
left Doctor David Devoll.</p>

<p>Brief reflection, however, convinced Patsy that that
would be a fatal mistake, that the chauffeur might be
in league with the physician, after all, and that this
stranger who had unexpectedly alighted from the
motor car might also be one of Doctor Devoll’s confederates,
sent by him to his road house on a mission
which he had thought it indiscreet to personally
undertake.</p>

<p>“I’ll hold my horses,” thought Patsy, with hopes
reviving. “There may be something doing, after all,
that will set me right. I’ll wait and see. He seems to
be giving that driver important instructions.”</p>

<p>The two men had been talking quietly in the driveway,
too low for Patsy to hear so much as a single
word, but the elderly man now turned abruptly up
the steps and peered into the hall for a moment, and
then entered the house.</p>

<p>The chauffeur closed the door of the car, then turned
and shot a searching glance in each direction, causing
Patsy to crouch lower in his concealment.</p>

<p>Presently, approaching the corner, the driver gazed
toward the rear of the house, then started abruptly<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
and walked completely around it, returning to the
same corner and taking a position from which he could
continue to watch the side windows, also the driveway
leading to the stable yard, on that side of the
house nearest to Patsy.</p>

<p>It was a situation that now precluded any move
on Patsy’s part. To approach any of the windows,
or even to steal away and seek an advantage elsewhere,
was out of the question. Detection would be inevitable.
He had no alternative but to lie low.</p>

<p>Minutes passed, and the chauffeur continued to wait
and watch, scarcely stirring from his position&mdash;all of
which convinced Patsy that his suspicions were correct,
that the elderly man was holding a conference
with some one and that the chauffeur was guarding
against spies outside.</p>

<p>That he was right appeared in what occurred when
the elderly man entered the house. He met no one
in the hall, save an aged black cat, and he quickly entered
a side room, in which a solitary man was waiting
with an empty whisky glass on the table near which
he was seated.</p>

<p>He was a tall man, close upon forty, very well clad,
having dark eyes and complexion, but a rather weak
cast of features. He was smooth-shaven. A combination
false mustache and beard had been removed and
was lying on the table. He looked up when the
other entered, saying a bit irritably:</p>

<p>“Well, you’re here, Graff, at last. What kept you?
I’ve been waiting half an hour.”</p>

<p>“But not idle!”</p>

<p>Graff spoke with a fiery gleam leaping up in his
eyes. He was the same Professor Graff, chemist, with<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
an office and a laboratory in the Waldmere Chambers,
who had appeared in the corridor soon after the corpse
of Gaston Todd was found, and who had blandly asserted,
when questioned by Nick Carter, that he was
not a physician and that his opinion regarding the fatality
would be worthless.</p>

<p>There was no blandness in his low voice just then,
however, nor any such quality.</p>

<p>“But not idle!” he repeated, with a fierce, sibilant
hiss, pointing to the whisky glass and then dashing
it to atoms in the fireplace. “You cut that out, Dorson,
while doing business with me. Booze is a damned
bad partner. It has brought you where you are and
made you my tool. Cut it out&mdash;entirely! Obey me,
Dorson, or&mdash;God help you!”</p>

<p>A resentful scowl appeared on Dorson’s face, which
was not without signs of past dissipation, but the
frown vanished quickly under the fiery rebuke of his
companion. He pulled himself up, nevertheless, and
said sullenly:</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure, Graff, that I’ll consent to be your
tool.”</p>

<p>“Not consent?” Professor Graff sneered icily.
“What are you saying? You have consented.”</p>

<p>“I can revoke&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not with me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. I’m not so sure.”</p>

<p>“I am.” Graff’s voice was cold, but his eyes were
like balls of fire. “There will be no revocation. You
will not withdraw from our compact.”</p>

<p>“What’s to prevent me?”</p>

<p>“Fear. If not fear&mdash;this.”</p>

<p>Professor Graff thrust his hand into his pocket and<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
drew a singular weapon. It resembled an automatic
revolver, with a cylinderlike device attached to the
barrel. There was no trigger, however, but only a
small, round button, on which the finger of the chemist
lightly rested. He displayed the weapon in his
hand, his lips parting with a mocking smile, while
Dorson started slightly and gazed at it incredulously.</p>

<p>“This will, if necessary, be our arbiter,” Graff
sneered. “I can end you with it in the hundredth
part of a second.”</p>

<p>“You would not dare,” gasped Dorson. “You would
bring Leary and the bartender. You would be caught
red-handed.”</p>

<p>“There would be no red hand, no bloodshed, no
sound,” Graff retorted. “It makes no noise, discharges
no bullet. But the effect is no less deadly. I
could leave you here as if you had fallen lifeless from
your chair, or as if&mdash;perdition! Are you still doubtful?
You shall see.”</p>

<p>There was something even more terrible in the aspect
of this man at that moment than in his threatening
words. He swung around quickly and quietly
opened the door. The black cat he had seen in the
hall still was there. He stepped out and seized the
animal, then returned and tossed him to a corner of the
room, closing the door.</p>

<p>The black cat was gazing with dilated yellow eyes
at the lowering chemist, as if surprised at such extraordinary
treatment.</p>

<p>“Watch!” Graff snapped fiercely, with one swift
glance at his horrified companion.</p>

<p>He extended his right hand and the strange weapon.
His piercing gaze leaped over the glistening barrel.<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
His finger pressed the round button in the cylinder.
There was a quick, explosive puff, yet hardly audible,
but the black cat dropped in a crumpled heap, with his
yellow eyes gone dim and glassy. The animal was
dead, as crimp and shriveled as if the hot breath of a
withering blight had passed over him.</p>

<p>Dorson caught his breath convulsively and tried
to speak, but his voice seemed to die in his throat.</p>

<p>Professor Graff kicked the lifeless cat farther into
the corner, then sat down directly opposite his ghastly
companion, as unconcerned as if nothing had transpired.
He replaced the mysterious weapon in his
pocket, saying coldly, yet pointedly:</p>

<p>“It is a very handy thing to have when circumstances
make it necessary.”</p>

<p>“It is devilish!” Dorson found his voice, shuddering,
and wiped the sweat from his brow. “It is fiendish!”</p>

<p>“But convincing?” queried Graff, with searching
scrutiny.</p>

<p>“Convincing&mdash;yes!” Dorson shuddered again.
“Enough has been done and said, but I wish I never
had seen you, never conspired with you.”</p>

<p>“But, having done so, there can be no revocation,
no retreat,” Graff said sternly. “I have seen signs of
it, Dorson, and I have to convince you.”</p>

<p>“Enough has been done and said,” Dorson repeated,
pulling himself together.</p>

<p>“Besides, there are other reasons,” Graff added.
“We are up against a tough proposition, one that is
hourly becoming more threatening; but of that a little
later. We’ll get right down to business.”</p>

<p>“The windows&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[135]</span></p>

<p>“Fear nothing. Toby Monk is watching them.”</p>

<p>“The door&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“None can approach it unheard. I have the ears of
a rat.”</p>

<p>“Be quick, then,” said Dorson more calmly. “The
sooner we leave here, Graff, the better.”</p>

<p>“Your identity has not been discovered?” questioned
the chemist quickly.</p>

<p>“No, no, nothing of that kind. It is not even suspected.”</p>

<p>“Nor will I be seen,” Graff said confidently. “I’ll
make sure of that, and have guarded against other
contingencies. Toby is disguised. His car bears a
false number. None will learn of our rendezvous, nor
even suspect it. Now, Dorson, have you brought the
invitations?”</p>

<p>“Yes, two of them,” said Dorson, producing two
sealed envelopes and placing them on the table.</p>

<p>“Good!” Graff seized them and put them in his
pocket. “From whom did you get them?”</p>

<p>“I stole them from those with which my aunt, Mrs.
Thurlow, was supplied to dispose of,” replied Dorson.
“She is one of the sponsors for the affair, and that
was the only way to get them without disclosing the
names of the persons who are to use them. No one
will be admitted without a card bearing his name.
It’s an exclusive affair. Fictitious names can be inscribed
on these.”</p>

<p>“Capital!” Graff nodded, smiling maliciously.
“What if your aunt misses them?”</p>

<p>“She will think she mislaid them, and can easily
explain to the managers. Her word is good.”</p>

<p>“None better,” Graff dryly admitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[136]</span></p>

<p>“What more must be done?” Dorson questioned.</p>

<p>“Take my final instructions.” Professor Graff drew
nearer the table and fixed his penetrating eyes on
those of his confederate. “You are in the social
swim, Dorson, and can execute them without incurring
the slightest suspicion.”</p>

<p>“That was the agreement. You promised that no
harm should come to me.”</p>

<p>“None will. Remember, too, that I promised you
ten thousand dollars for your share of the plunder.
That will more than pay your debts and set you on
your feet. It’s not a bad reward, Dorson, for a mere
bit of safe and important work.”</p>

<p>“That’s the only inducement.” Dorson’s face was
haggard and clouded. “I’ll chuck everything, honor
and self-respect, in order to square myself. But what
is this safe and important work? What must I do?”</p>

<p>Professor Graff took from his pocket a small celluloid
box with a close-fitting cover. He caressed
it fondly for a moment, with an abnormal gleam and
glitter in his narrow eyes, then leaned forward and
said impulsively:</p>

<p>“Listen! You are to take this, but do not for your
life venture to open it before the fateful moment arrives.
The box is air-tight, but its cover can be easily
removed. It contains only a lady’s handkerchief.”</p>

<p>“What am I to do with it?” Dorson asked, gazing
curiously at the smooth white box.</p>

<p>“Take it to the reception,” Graff directed. “You
are familiar with the ballroom and its surroundings,
with the row of French windows that open upon the
west balcony roof near the porte-cochère.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[137]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes, of course,” Dorson said impatiently. “I
know all that.”</p>

<p>“Note me, then,” Graff continued. “I will be at
the ball to give you a signal. We must not be seen
together, however, nor in any way betray that we are
acquainted.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Upon getting my signal, which you will receive
at an opportune moment when she is alone, you must
immediately join Mrs. Mortimer Thurlow, at the same
time stealthily opening the box and removing the
handkerchief.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“Give it to her at once, without a moment’s delay,
and remark she dropped it,” said Graff. “She will
infer that it is her own. If not, she will at least raise
it toward her face to examine it. Step back a little,
meantime, covering your nostrils, that you may inhale
no appreciable quantity of that with which the handkerchief
is impregnated.”</p>

<p>“What’s the stuff?” growled Dorson, brows knitting.</p>

<p>“Do not be curious.” Professor Graff spoke with
a frown. “I have confederates, but to none do I confide
my secrets. Take my instructions&mdash;and obey
them.”</p>

<p>“Well, what more?”</p>

<p>“Watch the woman,” Graff continued. “Only her
eyes will change perceptibly. A fixed expression will
immediately appear, and her pupils will contract to
mere pin points. Take her arm, then, and lead her
out through the nearest French window.”</p>

<p>“Suppose she refuses to go, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[138]</span></p>

<p>“She will not refuse or do anything else,” Graff interrupted.
“She will go willingly and without a word
or a subsequent recollection of what occurs. Place
her in the nearest chair on the balcony. Get the handkerchief
and return it to the box, then hasten to the
ballroom and go after a glass of water. You can
afterward assert that she sent you for it and said
she felt faint. She will admit it, for she will remember
nothing and cannot consistently deny it.”</p>

<p>“But the pearls?” Dorson questioned, eyes glowing.
“What of the rope of pearls?”</p>

<p>“There will be no rope of pearls.” Graff’s teeth
met with a vicious snap. “All that must be done can
be done in a single minute. When help comes, when
you return, when the woman revives, though all occurs
within a minute, there will be no rope of pearls. It
will have been stolen&mdash;mysteriously stolen.”</p>

<p>“But I may be suspected,” argued Dorson.</p>

<p>“Absurd! You could not possibly steal and dispose
of it under the seeming conditions. The woman
will believe she was faint only for a moment. She
will not be sure it was then that she lost the pearls.
She is your aunt, moreover, and would refuse to
suspect you.”</p>

<p>“But your infernal stuff may fail to work,” Dorson
suggested.</p>

<p>“It will not fail. It cannot fail.” Graff spoke with
convincing assurance. “I have tested it upon no less
than four subjects, Dorson, to make sure of success
in this undertaking. There is nothing for you to fear,
absolutely nothing.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tackle it, then, and take the chance.” Dorson<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
abruptly declared, thrusting the celluloid box into his
pocket. “Is there anything more?”</p>

<p>Professor Graff hesitated for a moment, then shook
his head.</p>

<p>“No, nothing for us to discuss,” he replied.</p>

<p>“But you mentioned a tough proposition that you
would speak of presently. What did you mean by
that?” Dorson demanded suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Only that an unexpected force is at work against
us, one that many would fear, and with which few
could successfully cope.” Graff’s voice took on a
more virulent intensity. “But I do not fear. I can
oppose and overcome it. My agents are already at
work. I have given warning, too, as I have warned
you, and if pressed too hard, if threats prove futile,
if the peril becomes really alarming&mdash;well, you see!
You have seen for yourself, Dorson, how I can overcome
it. There is always a way&mdash;always a way.”</p>

<p>Graff had swung around in his chair and was pointing
to the lifeless black form in the corner.</p>

<p>Dorson gazed at him, at his extended hand and
quivering fingers, at his drawn, bearded face, indescribably
malevolent, and with that terrible abnormal
gleam and glitter in his frowning eyes, and Dorson
felt, with blood chilled and flesh gone cold and
clammy, that he was gazing at a madman or a devil
incarnate.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I have seen enough, Graff, more than
enough,” he said hoarsely, lips twitching. “What
more need be said?”</p>

<p>“Nothing more.” Professor Graff turned coldly
calm again. “You have my instructions. I know you<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
will obey them. We must not meet again until after
the trick has been turned, and then only secretly.”</p>

<p>“That suits me. Let’s be moving.”</p>

<p>“How did you come out here?”</p>

<p>“In a trolley car.”</p>

<p>“You may return part way with me. I’ll drop you
before entering town. Resume your disguise, then
see whether the hall and veranda are deserted.”</p>

<p>Dorson arose and hastened to obey. He returned in
a few seconds, saying quietly:</p>

<p>“Come on. There’s no one around.”</p>

<p>There was one still around, nevertheless, still lying
low amid the rank grass and shrubbery that had served
to conceal him.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">VAIN INQUIRIES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Patsy Garvan had been waiting and watching about
fifteen minutes, the circumstances precluding any further
action, when he saw the two men come out of the
road house.</p>

<p>They hurried down the steps and entered the motor
car. Toby Monk, the chauffeur, also saw them,
and ran to resume his seat at the wheel. They were
away within half a minute, departing with very significant
haste and returning to Madison at a rate of
speed precluding pursuit, but leaving Patsy gazing
with an ominous frown after the rear red light till
it vanished in the distance.</p>

<p>“That does settle it,” he muttered grimly. “I’ve
lost track of them for a time, at least, in spite of anything
I can do. But I’ve got the number of that car,
all right, and I’ll identify them later as sure as there’s
juice in a lemon. I can find out, perhaps, by inquiring
of some one in the house. The third man may
hang out there, however, and I might get in wrong.
I think I can turn the trick at that, without incurring
suspicion,” he added to himself after a moment’s
thought. “I’ll take the chance, by gracious, let come
what may.”</p>

<p>Leaving his concealment, he walked out to the driveway,
where, having made sure there were no observers,
he threw himself on one side in the sand and dirt
and ground the palm of his right hand into the gravel,<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
a performance that might cause one to wonder what
advantage could be derived.</p>

<p>Patsy knew, however, and he immediately arose
and entered the road house. Though the hall still
was unoccupied, he could hear the voices of men in
the rear rooms, also the clinking of glasses, and he
rightly inferred that there was a public bar in one of
the rooms. He hastened thither and entered, with
a pretense of brushing his soiled garments and with
an indignant frown on his face.</p>

<p>“Say!” he exclaimed, approaching a bar on one
side of the room. “Who are the ginks that just left
here in a buzz wagon?”</p>

<p>Three men were playing cards at a table in one
corner, evidently quarry workmen from the near settlement,
each with a mug of ale at his elbow. Back
of the bar stood a burly man in his shirt sleeves, with
a much-bloated and pimply face, the redeeming feature
of which was an expression of habitual good
nature. He gazed at Patsy and laughed, replying to
his impetuous question, but the three card players
merely glanced at him.</p>

<p>“Buzz wagon, eh?” he said huskily. “I didn’t know
one was here.”</p>

<p>“Well there was.”</p>

<p>“Funny I didn’t hear it.”</p>

<p>“I came near feeling it, all right,” grumbled Patsy,
displaying his soiled hand. “It came out to the road
as if shot from a gun. It nearly ran over me. I
fell down while dodging it, as you see, but I reckon
I was lucky to get away with that. You don’t know
them, eh?”</p>

<p>“Mebbe ’twas the bloke who rang for the booze,<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
Jim,” suggested one of the players, looking up. “Have
you forgotten him, Leary?”</p>

<p>“The man who runs the house,” thought Patsy;
then, as if the identity of the visitors was of no great
consequence, he said agreeably: “I’ll have a mug of
ale. See what these gents will have and get in yourself.”</p>

<p>The invitation was readily accepted by all, and
Patsy paid willingly, thus paving the way for further
inquiries.</p>

<p>“I’m going to Madison,” he said, in reply to a question.
“I came from Ashville on the trolley line. How
soon can I hit another?”</p>

<p>“Twelve minutes, if she shows up on time,” said
Leary, glancing at a nickel watch. “It might have
been the man in the side room. I’ll have a look.”</p>

<p>“Twelve minutes, eh?” said Patsy, more quickly
drinking his ale when Leary swaggered out from the
bar and into the hall. “That’s not long. I don’t want
to miss it.”</p>

<p>He added the last to warrant his following the burly
proprietor, who obviously was so void of distrust that
Patsy very soon decided that none of these men had
had any intercourse with the two visitors and very
probably knew neither of them.</p>

<p>“No danger of missing it,” replied Leary, as they
approached the side room. “The motorman always
stops on the corner and rings his gong. He often
picks up a bunch from here.”</p>

<p>“I see,” returned Patsy pleasantly. “I needn’t be
in any rush, then.”</p>

<p>“No rush at all.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have time for another drink?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[144]</span></p>

<p>“Sure thing. Time enough for&mdash;&mdash;Huh, I’m
blessed if Kelly wasn’t right! The bloke has gone.”</p>

<p>Leary had knocked on the door, and then opened
it. He entered while speaking, Patsy following, and
again asking carelessly:</p>

<p>“Didn’t you know the man? Was he a stranger
here?”</p>

<p>“Sure he was.” Leary turned and gazed at him.
“I didn’t know him from a hole in the wall. He must
have known this room was for customers, though,
for he nailed it and rang for a drink.”</p>

<p>“He must have been here before, then, or he
wouldn’t have known it,” said Patsy.</p>

<p>“That’s right, too.” Leary nodded. “I brought
him the booze he ordered, and then he said he wanted
to wait for a friend and have a private talk with him.
He chucked me a buck for the booze and told me
to keep the change. That looked good to me and like
more coming, so I told him he could stay as long as
he liked, and would not be interrupted.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Patsy, now sure that Leary was telling
him the truth. “His friend came, all right, and
they went away together. There were three in the
car when&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But where’s the booze glass?” cried Leary, who
now had turned toward the table. “That ought to be
here. They would not steal a whisky glass, unless&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop a bit!” Patsy interrupted. “It was thrown
into the fireplace. Here are pieces of it, and&mdash;holy
smoke! This cat is dead!”</p>

<p>Patsy had caught sight of it a moment before, and
he at first had thought the animal was asleep. A second<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
look, however, evoked the last startling exclamation
and brought Leary to his knees near his lifeless
pet.</p>

<p>“Good God! What’s the meaning of this?” he
growled, with a scowl, convincing Patsy of his sincerity.
“Dead as an iron bolt! What’s the meaning
of it?”</p>

<p>“Has the cat been sick?” Patsy inquired.</p>

<p>“Sick&mdash;no!” cried Leary. “There’s been nothing
the matter with him. He was getting a bit old, but
was well enough. Poor old Gimblet!” Leary added,
with genuine feeling.</p>

<p>“Was he in this room when you were here?” asked
Patsy.</p>

<p>“No. He was asleep in the hall.”</p>

<p>“He may have wandered in here.”</p>

<p>“How could he? The door was closed.”</p>

<p>“H’m, is that so?” Patsy murmured, as puzzled
as the other and much more suspicious.</p>

<p>“He’s dead, all right, as a smelt.” Leary now
turned the animal over. “But I’ll be hanged if I can
see why the booze glass was smashed or why the cat
should have died. Something must have killed him.
Say, you don’t s’pose they gave him poison in that
glass, then smashed it, do you?” he added, quickly
turning to Patsy. “If I thought that, I’d go after
those mongrels with a gun, by thunder, and stick till
I got them!”</p>

<p>This possible fate was suggested to Leary by a
momentary expression that had passed over Patsy’s
face. He had detected a peculiar, shriveled appearance
in the fur on the cat’s breast and neck, and it
instantly recalled to his mind what his chief had said<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
concerning the man found dead in the Waldmere
Chambers two days before.</p>

<p>Patsy concealed his immediate misgivings, however,
but pretended to be impressed with Leary’s suggestions.</p>

<p>“That may explain it, Mr. Leary, if they had any
reason for wanting to kill the cat,” he replied. “The
fellow you saw probably did not do it. More likely
the old man was the one who killed him.”</p>

<p>“What old man?” Leary demanded, with a vengeful
glare in his eyes.</p>

<p>“The one I saw in the motor car,” said Patsy, now
aiming only to identify him, if possible. “He’s quite
a stocky man, with gray hair and whiskers. He wore
a plaid suit and soft felt hat. His chauffeur was bigger
and broader, with dark hair and a pointed beard.
I got a look at them when they flew by me.”</p>

<p>“I dunno any such men,” Leary earnestly protested.
“The whole business beats me to a frazzle.”</p>

<p>“It does seem a bit strange,” Patsy allowed. “You’ll
find out later, perhaps. I reckon I’ll be getting a
move on, as I don’t want to miss that car. I’m sorry
you have lost the cat. I’ll drop in again, when I’m
returning to Ashville.”</p>

<p>“All right, kid,” said Leary, brightening up and following
Patsy to the door. “If you see those two
blokes again, do me a favor, will you?”</p>

<p>“What’s that, Mr. Leary?”</p>

<p>“Get the truth out of them, if you have to get it
with a club.”</p>

<p>“I will,” Patsy promptly assured him. “Take it
from me, Mr. Leary, I’ll get it&mdash;and all there is to
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[147]</span></p>

<p>“Good for you!” Leary shouted after him heartily.</p>

<p>For Patsy already was hastening toward the road
leading out to the trolley line, something like a hundred
yards away. He had seen plainly that he could
learn nothing more at the road house. The negative
reports he had obtained, however, together with
the startling discovery he had made, convinced him
that his mission had not been a futile one.</p>

<p>“Leary’s all right,” he said to himself while walking
on rapidly. “He told me all he knows and gave
it to me straight. That rendezvous had been agreed
upon and the road house selected for a safe place. But
who are they and what came off in there? Why was
the whisky glass broken and the cat killed? In view
of all of the circumstances, by Jove, there’s a mighty
strong similarity between that fatality and the killing
of Gaston Todd. It becomes doubly important now
to trace and identify these rascals, and I reckon I’m
in a fair way to accomplish it. All this, moreover,
seems to put Doctor Devoll in the background. That
is, if I size it all up correctly. I’ll hike back to the
Wilton House, by Jove, and report to the chief.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter’s strong, clean-cut face took on a more
serious expression while he listened. It was half past
eight when Patsy returned, just as Nick was about
leaving the Wilton House, and only half an hour after
Chick set forth to search the apartments of Gaston
Todd.</p>

<p>“That’s all, chief,” said Patsy, when ending his report.
“As far as I can see, it lets Doctor Devoll out
of the circle of suspicion and rings in another, no
less than three, in fact&mdash;the chauffeur, his elderly passenger,
and the man he met at the road house. For
I’ll wager my pile, chief, that the chauffeur knew there
was something doing and was acting as a sentinel.”</p>

<p>“Are you absolutely sure that the elderly passenger
was not Doctor Devoll?” Nick inquired.</p>

<p>“Reasonably sure, chief, at least,” said Patsy confidently.
“He is too solid and compact for Devoll,
more erect and with broader shoulders. Devoll is
somewhat bowed and very slim. He looks like a
string bean.”</p>

<p>“He may have disguised himself while in the motor
car,” Nick suggested.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” Patsy quickly objected. “He
would hardly have covered all of the features mentioned.
Besides, I could see the interior of the car
distinctly when the door was open, and I would have
seen his discarded hat and garments.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[149]</span></p>

<p>“That does seem probable,” Carter thoughtfully
admitted. “Don’t you overlook one fact, however?”</p>

<p>“What’s that, chief?”</p>

<p>“That you saw Doctor Devoll leave the hospital
and ride away with the chauffeur. You could not
then have been mistaken as to the physician’s identity,
and the circumstances convince me that he is in
some way associated with the two men who met in
the road house.”</p>

<p>“I think so, too, chief, as far as that goes,” said
Patsy.</p>

<p>“It appears probable, too, that the chauffeur is one
of the gang,” Carter added. “Also that we are up
against more of a gang than I have suspected. I at
first was inclined to attribute the many mysterious
robberies here, as well as the killing of Gaston Todd,
to a single exceedingly crafty and accomplished
crook. I now believe, however, that he is the chief
director of a gang, instead of at work alone.”</p>

<p>“That must be right, too,” nodded Patsy. “There’s
no getting around it.”</p>

<p>“But here’s another point,” said Carter. “The
mysterious killing of Leary’s cat, whatever the motive
of it, and the similar strangeness in connection
with the murder of Todd denote that both were committed
by the same man or some of his gang.”</p>

<p>“That’s how I size it up.”</p>

<p>“You are sure, however, that neither of the men
at the road house was Doctor Devoll,” Nick continued.
“I may in that case be mistaken in thinking he
is the man behind the gun, the evil genius back of
the whole business. There may be another, and Doctor
Devoll only indirectly associated with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>

<p>“You mean the elderly man who took Doctor Devoll’s
place in the motor car?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“Devoll may have sent him out to the road house
to meet that other fellow,” Patsy suggested.</p>

<p>“Possibly,” said Nick. “It is more probable, however,
that Devoll informed him of my visit this afternoon
and of the threats I made. The other may have
become alarmed and set about thwarting my designs.
All this appears the more probable, Patsy, because
that threatening anonymous letter and all these very,
significant episodes have followed so quickly after my
call on Doctor Devoll.”</p>

<p>“Right again, chief, as sure as I’m a foot high,”
Patsy declared. “It’s long odds, too, that the road-house
conference was held only to frame up a job
on you.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that,” his chief replied. “They
may have met to plan the theft of Mrs. Mortimer
Thurlow’s pearls or to alter plans made before the
threatening letter was sent to me.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe so,” Patsy allowed. “It’s a pity I couldn’t
overhear the discussion and see what came off.”</p>

<p>“We’ll make use of what you have discovered, not
mourn over what was impossible,” said Carter dryly.
“We must now contrive to identify those three men.
All wore beards, you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Possibly, then, all were disguised. You have the
number of the motor car, however, and that may
help, barring trickery of some kind. Such crafty
rascals as these don’t often let a license number expose<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
them. There is a possibility, nevertheless, that
they overlooked it.”</p>

<p>“The chance is worth taking.”</p>

<p>“Surely. You go over to the garage and see what
you can learn,” Carter directed, rising and taking his
hat. “I have other business in the meantime, and
will return about ten o’clock. Chick then will have
shown up perhaps and have something to report. Get
your information on the quiet, mind you.”</p>

<p>“Trust me for that, chief,” said Patsy, as they were
leaving the room together.</p>

<p>Nick Carter’s other business, or part of it, consisted
of keeping a promise he had made the previous
morning. He called at the city prison, confiding
his identity and mission to the warden, and
was promptly accorded an interview with Frank
Paulding in the warden’s private office.</p>

<p>Nick did not expect, however, that Paulding would
have any information to impart. He called on him
only because of his promise and to say a few words
of encouragement to the suspected man, also to direct
him to maintain the negative position he had
taken.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll continue to do so, Mr. Carter, as I agreed
with you yesterday morning,” Paulding assured him.
“It’s a bitter pill for an innocent man to swallow,
but I’ll not weaken. I’ll stick, sir, as long as I know
you are working for me.”</p>

<p>“You may depend upon that,” the detective said
simply.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven, too, there is one rift in the clouds,”
Paulding added.</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[152]</span></p>

<p>“A letter from Edna Thurlow. It came this morning.
She expresses her sympathy for me, her belief
that I am a victim of circumstances, and assures me
of her absolute faith in my innocence.”</p>

<p>“Good for her!” said Carter, smiling. “It’s very
significant, too.”</p>

<p>“Significant?”</p>

<p>“Surely,” laughed the detective. “A girl writes
like that only to one she loves. You were not quite
sure of it, you remember. This ought to convince
you and really make it worth while to be suspected.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure but it does,” replied Paulding, brightening
up. “I do regret one restriction, however, that
you have imposed on me. It’s a thorn in my flesh.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” said the detective tersely.</p>

<p>“You know it? How the deuce can you know it?
You don’t know to what restriction I refer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I do.” Nick laughed again. “Though
not a lover, I know how lovers feel. You itch to relieve
Miss Thurlow’s anxiety by telling her of our
relations.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, you’re a keen cuss, Carter!” Paulding
declared, now joining in the detective’s laugh.
“You’ve called the turn, all right, but itch doesn’t
express it. Really, I ache to do so.”</p>

<p>“Well, stop aching,” Nick said dryly, rising to go.
“I shall see Miss Thurlow this evening, and will tell
her all that she needs to know.”</p>

<p>“See her!” Paulding sprang up, eyes glowing. “Oh,
I say, then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, no, don’t say it,” the detective cut in with
affected alarm. “I’ll not take any love messages to
her. I draw the line at that. I have passed that<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
stage, you know, and would only make an awful mess
of it, to say nothing of making a fool of myself. I
will tell her enough, Paulding, however; so rest easy
with that until I can see you again.”</p>

<p>Nick left him with a much lighter heart than when
he had entered, which was what he chiefly desired,
but his mission to the Thurlow residence was of
greater importance.</p>

<p>It was nine o’clock when he arrived at the house,
one of the most costly and beautiful dwellings in Madison.
He was admitted by an elderly butler, who invited
him to a seat in a handsomely furnished reception
room.</p>

<p>Nick had given him a card on which he had written
only his first name, stating that he called on important
business, and he had been waiting only a few
moments when a graceful, strikingly pretty girl in an
evening gown joined him, still with the card in her
hand.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” she said agreeably, with an inquiring
look in her blue eyes. “I am Miss Thurlow,
Mr. Nicholas, but I infer that your business is with
my mother. She has gone up to her room, but I
have sent for her to come down. Your name does not
suggest any business which&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It might, perhaps, if I had written my full name&mdash;Nicholas
Carter,” he interposed, bowing and smiling.</p>

<p>“Nicholas Carter!” gasped Edna, staring at him.
“Not the famous New York detective?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, thanking you for the complimentary
adjective.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” exclaimed Edna amazedly. “Are<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
you a wizard? Do you ride on the wind? How did
you get here so quickly?”</p>

<p>“Get here?” queried Carter, though he at once
guessed the truth. “You were expecting me then?”</p>

<p>“Well, not so quickly, of course,” said the girl.
“But I telegraphed to you no less than an hour ago,
asking you to come immediately to Madison. I did
not suppose you could cover hundreds of miles in as
many seconds. I thought when the bell rang that
you had wired back, and this name on the card meant
nothing to me. Really, Mr. Carter, I am quite mystified.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter laughed pleasantly, and replied:</p>

<p>“I will presently explain. Why, may I ask, did you
send for me to come to Madison?”</p>

<p>“I want you to investigate a very mysterious murder,”
Edna now earnestly explained. “A very dear
friend of mine is suspected and is under arrest. I
am sure he is innocent, however, absolutely sure; but
I can see no way to prove it. I want you to find a
way. Money is no object, Mr. Carter, for he is very
dear to me and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pardon.” Nick checked her more gravely. “It
would be unkind for me to leave you in the dark and
let you continue to speak so feelingly. I know all
about your friend. I left him only a few minutes
ago. Like you, too, I know that he is innocent. I
already am at work to prove it, Miss Thurlow, and
Paulding has from the first been acting under my instructions.”</p>

<p>It would be impossible to describe the expression
of astonishment on Edna Thurlow’s pretty face upon
hearing these disclosures, but before she could collect<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
herself and reply a stately, very handsome, and
distinguished-looking woman entered from the hall,
saying quite graciously:</p>

<p>“What was that I heard? Mr. Paulding acting
under your instructions, sir?”</p>

<p>Carter turned and bowed, while Edna immediately
introduced her mother, hastily informing her of the
detective’s identity and his startling statements. The
detective then accepted an invitation to accompany
them to the library, where he not only dispelled their
perplexity, but also greatly relieved their anxiety by
telling them of his relations with Paulding and, in
a strictly confidential way, the nature of his mission.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, however, I have called to
see you on other business, Mrs. Thurlow,” he said
a little later. “It is your intention, I have heard, to
attend the reception ball of the National Guards to-morrow
evening.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, both of us,” Mrs. Thurlow replied.
“I am one of the sponsors and the director of the
ladies’ reception committee.”</p>

<p>“Is it to be quite an elaborate affair?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Carter, quite so.”</p>

<p>“I understand that you own a very valuable rope of
pearls, which you intend wearing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, surely.” Mrs. Thurlow regarded him with
a look of surprise. “When would I wear it, if not
on such an occasion? I wonder at your having heard
of my pearls, however.”</p>

<p>“I have heard something more,” Carter informed
her. “I cannot honorably conceal the fact from you,
property of such value being in jeopardy, but I hope<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
you will consent to act upon my advice and instructions.”</p>

<p>“In jeopardy?” Mrs. Thurlow questioned, turning
pale. “What do you mean, Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p>“I mean, Mrs. Thurlow, that an attempt will be
made to steal them.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” gasped Edna. “How shocking,
mamma!”</p>

<p>“Steal them?” Mrs. Thurlow smiled expressively.
“Well, well, that can be easily prevented. I will not
wear them.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would say so,” Nick replied. “On
the contrary, however, I want you to wear them and
to conduct yourself precisely as if you knew nothing
about the danger, which I felt constrained to disclose.
Let me tell you the circumstances.”</p>

<p>He then proceeded to do so, showing her the anonymous
letter, and then interrogating her about nearly
every feature of the complicated case. His inquiries
proved vain, however, for both Mrs. Thurlow and
her daughter were entirely in the dark as to the identity
and motives of the criminals involved.</p>

<p>“But why, Mr. Carter, having informed me of the
danger, do you want me to wear the pearls?” Mrs.
Thurlow inquired. “That will be indiscreet, at least.”</p>

<p>“Less so than you suppose,” the detective assured
her. “I will take every possible precaution to protect
them and prevent the theft. Your wearing them,
however, will give me an opportunity to identify and
capture these miscreants.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see!” Mrs. Thurlow exclaimed. “But do
you think you can accomplish it?”</p>

<p>“I am very sure of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[157]</span></p>

<p>“Well, to tell the truth, Mr. Carter, I have great
confidence in you,” Mrs. Thurlow said earnestly.
“Your frankness in this matter, moreover, when you
could have had what you ask by leaving me in ignorance,
constrains me to take the risk. It would be
a benefit to rid this community of the knaves with
which it long has been infested, and I’ll take the chance
and do my part. I will wear the rope of pearls, Mr.
Carter.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, mamma!” said Edna, with some enthusiasm.
“I’ll wager that Mr. Carter will make
good.”</p>

<p>Nick smiled and thanked her; then added more seriously:</p>

<p>“But you must conduct yourselves, both of you,
precisely as if ignorant of the circumstances. Do not
mention them to any person or the fact that I have
called here. Much may depend upon your doing exactly
what I direct.”</p>

<p>“You may rely upon us to do so,” Mrs. Thurlow
assured him.</p>

<p>“Very good,” said the detective. “Tell me, now,
who is to be your escort.”</p>

<p>“My nephew, John Dorson.”</p>

<p>“Jack will look after both of us, Mr. Carter, owing
to Mr. Paulding’s dreadful predicament,” Edna
added.</p>

<p>“My instructions include him also,” Nick said,
though not then dreaming the actual need of it. “Do
not confide anything to Mr. Dorson. He might be
so vigilant and attentive to you, Mrs. Thurlow, that
the crooks would not attempt the theft. That would,
of course, preclude my catching them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[158]</span></p>

<p>“We will be governed accordingly,” Mrs. Thurlow
again assured him.</p>

<p>Nick lingered only to add a few minor instructions.
It was after eleven o’clock when he returned to the
Wilton House, now feeling sure that he would outwit
the unknown crooks in any game they might attempt
to play and that more definite discoveries concerning
them would speedily be made.</p>

<p>The detective had further proof of their craft and
sagacity, however, upon entering his suite. For he
found Patsy Garvan waiting for him, who had learned
that the automobile having the State license number
he had looked up was owned by one of the leading
bankers in the State, who dwelt more than a hundred
miles from Madison.</p>

<p>“It could not have been his car that I saw,” declared
Patsy, after reporting the facts. “That’s a
cinch, chief, and it admits of only one conclusion.
That chauffeur had false number plates, or had altered
his own in some way.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter’s brows knitted ominously, but he did
not comment upon this further evidence of knavish
foresight. Instead, he asked a bit abruptly:</p>

<p>“Have you seen Chick?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said Patsy. “He has not returned.”</p>

<p>“That looks bad, too.” Nick spoke with a growl.
“It ought not to have taken him three hours to search
Todd’s apartments. It could have been done in half
that time. Can it be that anything has gone wrong
there also and that these rascals&mdash;&mdash;Get your hat,
Patsy,” he abruptly digressed. “Get a move on and
go with me. We’ll have a look at Todd’s apartments.”</p>

<p>It was nearly twelve o’clock when, having aroused<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
the night manager of the Studley, they obtained admission
to the rooms of the murdered man and
switched on the electric light. The scene that met
their gaze brought a horrified ejaculation from the
manager and a cry of dismay from Patsy Garvan.</p>

<p>Chick was lying where he had fallen, with his arms
extended, his right sleeve drawn up a little, and with
his face upturned in the bright light, as ghastly white
as the face of a dead man.</p>

<p>The rooms were in shocking disorder. A roll-top
desk had been broken open and looted from top to
bottom. Table drawers, those of a bureau and chiffonier,
a trunk in the wardrobe closet&mdash;the contents
of all had been pulled out and scattered broadcast over
the floor. From end to end, in fact, the apartments
had been thoroughly searched.</p>

<p>“By thunder, this was not Chick’s work!” cried
Carter, with features turning flinty. “We have been
balked again, balked by this gang of infernal&mdash;&mdash;What
do you say, Patsy? He’s not dead, surely! I
can see that plainly.”</p>

<p>Patsy then was crouching on the floor beside the
prostrate detective.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">NICK DECLARES HIMSELF.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Nick Carter was right as to Chick’s condition. He
had seen at a glance that he was not dead. He quickly
noticed, too, the sleeve drawn up above his right wrist,
exposing part of the arm, and he immediately joined
Patsy and pointed to a tiny puncture in the white
skin.</p>

<p>“He has been drugged,” said he, with an indignant
ring in his subdued voice. “That’s the prick of a
hypodermic needle.”</p>

<p>“Surely,” muttered Patsy. “But how did they contrive
to get him and the&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me how. It’s useless to speculate,” Carter
interrupted. “They shall pay dear for it, nevertheless,
take my word for that. Is there a physician
in the house, Mr. Vernon?” he added, turning to the
astonished manager.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is,” was the hasty reply. “Doctor
Percy. His suite is on this floor.”</p>

<p>“Bring him as quickly as possible,” the detective
directed. “Tell him that stimulants will be needed to
counteract a drug, but don’t create a stir or cause any
excitement. There is no occasion to arouse the house.
He soon can revive this man.”</p>

<p>Carter had no doubt of it after a hasty examination,
and in a very few minutes Doctor Percy came
in and set to work over the unconscious detective,<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
applying such restoratives as the case seemed to require.</p>

<p>In the meantime, with Patsy at his elbow, Nick
made a thorough inspection of the several rooms. He
found a window in the bedroom unlocked, and on
the platform of the fire escape he discovered, with
the help of his search light, the faint tracks left by
the masked man whom Chick had encountered about
three hours before.</p>

<p>“How it was done, Patsy, now is quite obvious,”
Carter said grimly. “Some one, probably more than
one, was here in advance of Carter or entered about
the same time. Chick was caught unawares, I think,
and overcome by the rascals.”</p>

<p>“But how could they have anticipated his visit?”
questioned Patsy perplexedly.</p>

<p>“They did not,” Nick replied. “They did, however,
anticipate something else.”</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>“That I would search these rooms, Patsy, and the
same farsighted rascal who sent me the anonymous
letter undertook to get in his work ahead of me.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, I guess that’s right, chief.”</p>

<p>“He knew that I would seek for any evidence that
Todd might have left here, and he sent one or more
of his gang to prevent me from getting it. They
have succeeded, too, if Todd really left anything, for
they have cleaned up completely.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! I should say so,” Patsy agreed. “They
didn’t miss nook or corner.”</p>

<p>“It was the work of the same gang, but other members
of it than you saw at the road house,” Carter
added. “Their chief, or the director of these various<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
steps, is certainly an infernally keen and farsighted
knave. He not only discovered my identity and presence
in Madison, but also has contrived to anticipate
and balk my every important move. But I’ll finally
get him and every mother’s son of them. We’ll not
rest until we have run down the entire gang and&mdash;&mdash;Ah,
by Jove, that was Chick’s voice.”</p>

<p>They had been briefly talking in the bedroom, from
which both hastened upon hearing the familiar voice,
and they found Chick propped up against a chair, with
his eyes open. He was responding rapidly to the
stimulants given him, and he soon was able to clearly
describe his encounter with the masked man.</p>

<p>Not until the following morning, however, being
averse to discussing his suspicions in the presence of
Vernon and the physician, and knowing that no further
steps could be taken that night, did Carter express
his views on the subject. He then was at breakfast
with Patsy and Chick, the latter having entirely
recovered from the effects of the drug.</p>

<p>“Your sudden collapse, Chick, and the sensations
preceding it admit of only one explanation,” said
Carter. “Your assailant was provided with a powerful
storage battery, so ingeniously contrived and
carried on his person that he could impart an overwhelming
shock to an antagonist without incurring
danger from the electric current.”</p>

<p>“That’s how I size it up,” Chick agreed. “The
sensations were very convincing.”</p>

<p>“It could be accomplished with an ingenious arrangement
of wires,” Carter added. “Having knocked
you out, so to speak, and knowing you soon would
throw off the effects of the brief shock, he immediately<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
drugged you with a hypodermic injection, and
then proceeded to deliberately do what I had sent you
there to accomplish.”</p>

<p>“He got the best of me, all right,” Chick admitted.</p>

<p>“All this is very significant, however,” Carter said
more earnestly. “The ingenuity displayed, this use
of electricity, of drugs, of strange poisonous gas,
with a knowledge how it can be administered so as
to mysteriously cause death, as in Todd’s case, together
with the similar circumstances in the remarkable
robberies committed here, also in the cases of
the four girls found unconscious in the hospital
grounds&mdash;all evince a profound knowledge of such
things, that of the one man by whom all of these
crimes were devised and directed.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” Chick nodded, laying aside his
napkin. “Only one man would probably be so well
informed and knavishly original.”</p>

<p>“He is either a criminal genius or a madman whose
perverted mind has turned to crime for profit and
excitement. That man must be found, though we
turn heaven and earth to discover his identity.”</p>

<p>Though he still had Doctor Devoll in mind as being
the one whom several minor circumstances had
led him to suspect, Carter did not once think of Professor
Karl Graff, whom he had seen only for a couple
of minutes when investigating the death of Gaston
Todd, and whose appearance and deportment were
in no degree impressive, to say nothing of inviting
suspicion.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” Patsy exclaimed, replying. “It strikes
me, chief, that that motor car is a clew worth following.
We know that one of the two men at the road<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
house killed Leary’s cat, and it’s dollars to fried rings
that he is the man we want to identify. In spite of
the false number plates used last night, I think I can
run down that car, if I go on a still hunt for it.”</p>

<p>“Think you can, eh?” queried Carter tersely.</p>

<p>“I sure do,” said Patsy confidently.</p>

<p>“There are about a thousand cars of that type in
Madison. You’ll do good work, Patsy, if you round
up that particular one.”</p>

<p>“Good work is my long suit, chief,” Patsy earnestly
argued. “You ought to know that.”</p>

<p>“So I do, Patsy.”</p>

<p>“Let me try, then. I’ll bet I can make good.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” Carter abruptly decided. “Set to
work as soon as you like. In the meantime, Chick, I
will see Chief Gleason and get cards for to-night. I
want you to accompany me. If this master criminal,
whoever he is, can put one over on us and get away
with Mrs. Thurlow’s pearls, I’ll chuck my vocation
and start a peanut stand.”</p>

<p>Nick arose from the table with the last,
all having finished their breakfast, and Patsy
was so eager to be off on the work he had
voluntarily assumed and the outcome of which
he had so confidently predicted that he hurried up
to their suite in advance of the others, getting such
articles as he required and leaving the house without
further instructions.</p>

<p>Nick Carter sauntered into police headquarters
about ten o’clock that morning, and found Chief Gleason
in his private office.</p>

<p>“Too busy to see me?” he inquired carelessly when<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
the chief looked up and then swung quickly around
in his swivel chair.</p>

<p>“Too busy? I should say not!” he exclaimed, with
a perceptible frown. “I was expecting to see you.”</p>

<p>“That so?” queried Nick, while he drew up a chair.</p>

<p>“Very much so,” Gleason said brusquely. “See
here, Carter, what are you putting over on me?”</p>

<p>“Putting over on you?” Nick’s eyes narrowed
slightly.</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite get you, Gleason.”</p>

<p>“You ought to get me. Why haven’t I seen you
since yesterday morning? Why haven’t you reported?
In other words, Carter, what are you doing about this
Todd murder and these other cases?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s it, is it?” said Nick, who had been wondering
what was coming. “I had begun to fear there
was something wrong. Putting over on you, eh?
Did you really expect me, Gleason, to run in here every
hour or two and report the progress of my work?
That’s not my way of doing business.”</p>

<p>“I know, Carter; I know,” Gleason more quietly
protested, warned by a subtle ring in the detective’s
voice. “But we really have nothing on Paulding, nothing
at all definite, nothing that warrants holding him
in custody. It was upon your advice that we arrested
him.”</p>

<p>“I guess you have made no mistake.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He has not kicked against it, has he?”</p>

<p>“No, no, not exactly, yet&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop a moment,” Nick interrupted. “How long<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
were you and your score of subordinates at work on
these mysterious crimes before you sent for me?”</p>

<p>“Why, several months, as you know.”</p>

<p>“And accomplished nothing.”</p>

<p>“Why, nothing material.”</p>

<p>“Several months and nothing accomplished,” said
Nick pointedly. “I have been in Madison only two
days, Gleason, yet you expect me to begin turning in
reports and possibly to have solved the problem that
has baffled you for months. Don’t be foolish, Gleason.
Rome was not built in a day.”</p>

<p>“But you might at least keep me informed now and
then as to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” Nick cut in again. “I’ll report, Gleason,
when I have anything worth reporting, and not
until then. If that doesn’t satisfy the Madison chief
of police, I’ll chuck the whole business and hike back
to New York.”</p>

<p>“No, no, don’t say that,” Chief Gleason quickly entreated.
“I may have been a bit impatient, Carter,
but only because of my anxiety concerning Paulding,
who really is a very decent fellow. I don’t want to
put him in wrong, you know.”</p>

<p>“I am the one who has done the putting, Gleason,
and I will take all of the responsibility,” Nick replied.
“But do not be impatient or needlessly anxious.
There will be something doing sooner or later,
and you shall know all about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, that ought to satisfy me, I suppose,
coming from you,” Gleason said more agreeably. “I
should have known better than to have questioned
your judgment. Have you discovered anything
worthy of mention?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[167]</span></p>

<p>“Not yet, but I’m on the way,” the detective said
evasively. “I can tell you nothing definite at present.
Incidentally, however, I wish to attend the reception
and ball of the National Guards this evening. I suppose
you have been called upon to take the customary
precautions.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” Gleason quickly nodded. “Ten of
my men are to be there in plain clothes. It will be
a swell affair, with much costly jewelry worn, no
doubt, and we are taking unusual precautions.”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” Carter said approvingly. “I want
you to get me two tickets and the necessary cards.”</p>

<p>“I can give them to you now.” Gleason opened a
drawer in his desk. “I was supplied with a dozen,
but need only ten. Here are the other two.”</p>

<p>“Good enough.” Nick slipped them into his pocket.
“Say nothing about my going, by the way, for I don’t
want that generally known. After this ball, Gleason,
I may have something to report,” he said significantly,
while he arose to go.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">PATSY ON THE TRAIL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Good work is right. It sure will be some stunt
to find that particular car, as the chief said, but there’s
more than one way to kill a cat. I’ll find it, by gracious,
or lose a leg.”</p>

<p>These were Patsy Garvan’s mental declarations
when he left the Wilton House at nine o’clock that
morning, not only determined to find the motor car
he had seen the previous night, but also to identify its
chauffeur and his two passengers.</p>

<p>“I’ll go the whole hog,” he added to himself. “If
I discover the chauffeur, I’ll not quit till I have learned
who was with him. I’ll make good the limit, if I
make good at all.”</p>

<p>His first visit proved futile, and he then consulted
a directory and noted the location of every public
garage. He then proceeded from one to another as
quickly as possible, searching each in the same way,
but with the same negative result.</p>

<p>In only one was he questioned by the proprietor,
but Patsy was ready for him, and politely explained.</p>

<p>“I am thinking of buying a car next month, sir, and
am merely having a look at these. I hope you have
no objection.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not in that case,” was the reply. “Go
as far as you like.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go far and go some, I reckon, before I hook
onto the right one,” thought Patsy, who then had<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
been thus at work for several hours, stopping only
for lunch in a convenient restaurant. “The car might
be out, of course, even if I were to hit the right
garage, providing it is kept in a public one. I’ve got
to take the chance. I’ll stick, too, by ginger, till I
find it.”</p>

<p>It was after three o’clock when he emerged from
the last garage on his list, and his face wore a look
of irrepressible disappointment, though his ardor and
determination had not waned.</p>

<p>“Where next?” he asked himself. “The day is
two-thirds gone and I’m no better off than when I
started. It would be impossible to visit every private
garage. Nor could I identify that chauffeur in a passing
car if he was in disguise last night, or tell whether
the number plates have been removed or temporarily
changed by some means. If changed, by Jove, there’s
one way that might be done. There may be something
in this.”</p>

<p>He was hit with a new idea, one that immediately
struck him as promising. He had in mind, of course,
that all of the license plates of that State were blue
and numbered with white figures. Returning to the
business section, from which his long search had taken
him, he again consulted a directory and made a list
of the paint stores, one of which he presently entered
and questioned the proprietor.</p>

<p>His inquiries proved vain, however, and he hastened
to another. Not until close upon five o’clock
was he successful, when, accosting the proprietor of
a small shop in a side street, he began the same line
of inquiries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[170]</span></p>

<p>“Do you keep vaseline or a paste of any kind that
I could color with a pigment?”</p>

<p>“I have vaseline in small jars. What color do you
want to make it?”</p>

<p>“Prussian blue,” said Patsy, that being the body
color of the number plates.</p>

<p>“You can mix the Prussian blue powder with the
vaseline all right?”</p>

<p>“Making a paste that would stick for a time and
then wipe off easily?”</p>

<p>“Yes, surely.”</p>

<p>“Do you have many calls for Prussian blue?”</p>

<p>“Not many. You are the second one within a week,
though,” said the proprietor. “Toby Monk bought
a box three or four days ago. That’s the second,
by the way, that he has bought within a month. He
uses it mebbe the same as you do.”</p>

<p>“What’s his business? I’m an artist,” said Patsy,
lest these inquiries might reach the ears of the said
Toby Monk.</p>

<p>“He’s a chauffeur,” replied the storekeeper. “He
owns a car and runs it as a jitney part of the time,
when he’s not driving for a man who frequently employs
him.”</p>

<p>“What man is that?” inquired Patsy, suppressing
any betrayal of his elation.</p>

<p>“I don’t know his name.”</p>

<p>“Or where he lives?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“He’s a merchant, perhaps, or a doctor, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about him. Why are you
so anxious to know who and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not anxious,” Patsy cut in quickly. “I<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
was only wondering how the fellow you spoke of
used the color. Give me one can of it, smallest size,
and a small jar of vaseline.”</p>

<p>Patsy’s explanation was glibly made, and the storekeeper
appeared to attach no further significance to
his customer’s curiosity. He wrapped up the two articles,
and Patsy paid him and departed, afterward
tossing the package mentioned among some weeds in
a vacant lot.</p>

<p>“Only a lunkhead would have questioned him further,”
he said to himself, now feeling almost sure
that he had hit the right trail. “Toby Monk, eh? I’ll
soon find out where he lives and what is generally
known about him. Bought Prussian blue twice, has
he? It’s a hundred to one that he has been using it
to temporarily blot out a figure with blue paste matching
the background of his number plate, or to so cover
part of one or more figures as to form others, apparently
giving the plate an entirely different number
when engaged in a job like that of last night.
Blue paste could be quickly wiped off after the job was
done. I’ll find out mighty soon whether I am right
and have nailed one of the suspects.”</p>

<p>He hastened to a near drug store, and again resorted
to the city directory. He found that Toby
Monk lodged in Green Street, and thither he then
hastened.</p>

<p>He learned, after a little roundabout questioning in
an opposite cigar store, that Toby Monk kept his car
in an unused stable about a block away, and that he
could usually be found between six and seven o’clock
in Foley’s saloon and restaurant in Prince Street,
where he often went for his beer and supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[172]</span></p>

<p>It then was nearly six, with dusk beginning to
gather, and Patsy lost no time in seeking the stable
mentioned. It stood in the back yard of an inferior
wooden dwelling. The stable door was open, and the
car stood within, apparently the one he had pursued
the previous night, though he could not now see the
number plates.</p>

<p>“I must make dead sure of it,” he said to himself,
after sauntering by the house and turning merely a
furtive gaze toward the stable. “Toby Monk may
be in this house, since his car is here, and I’d better
not venture through the yard. I’ll go round to the
next street and steal between those two houses back
of the stable. There may be a back window, and I
could easily climb the fence.”</p>

<p>It took him about three minutes to reach the rear
of the stable, which he accomplished without being
seen, and he found the window he was seeking. He
found it unlocked, moreover, and within half a minute
he was crouching back of the touring car, inspecting
the number plate.</p>

<p>It was as clean as a whistle, though the rest of the
car was quite dusty. Obviously it had been recently
wiped. Plainly, too, the number, 12674, could be apparently
changed to 2671, the very number he had
seen the previous night, by eliminating the 1 and the
loop of the 4 by covering them with the blue paste.</p>

<p>“By Jove, this does settle it!” Patsy muttered, after
a brief inspection. “Here’s a smooch of dirty blue
grease, too, on the tire. Possibly I can find the&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Turning quickly, he discovered what he had in mind.
A wad of cotton waste soiled with greasy blue paste
had been tossed amid some rubbish in one corner.<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
On a beam near by was an open can of Prussian blue
powder, and near it a tin box containing some of the
paste and a soiled brush.</p>

<p>Patsy did not want more convincing evidence. He
stole out by the way he had entered, easily departing
unseen in the deepening dusk, and feeling reasonably
sure that Toby Monk then would be found
in the saloon mentioned.</p>

<p>“I’ll have a look, at all events,” he said to himself.
“Toby was the chauffeur, all right, and through him
I may identify the others. Gee whiz! It’s lucky I
thought of that method to alter the number plate. It
put me on the right track. I’ll drop the chief a line
in the next letter box, lest I unexpectedly throw a
shoe, and then I’ll keep up my good work. I’ll be
hanged if I’ll quit a trail that’s just warming up.”</p>

<p>It was half past six, and dusk had turned to darkness,
when Patsy approached Foley’s saloon in Prince
Street, within a block of police headquarters. It
was a restaurant and barroom of the better class, with
a corresponding patronage, and he paused briefly on
the opposite side to gaze through the broad plate-glass
windows.</p>

<p>He could see nearly a score of men in the saloon,
some talking and drinking at the bar, others seated
in a row of side booths, and nearly as many in the
rear restaurant. He was unable to discover one so
like the chauffeur in height and figure as to be sure
of his identity, however, and he then decided to enter
and use his wits. Approaching the bar, he bought
a glass of beer and lingered to drink it moderately.
Taking a moment when one of the bartenders was
idle and near him, he inquired carelessly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[174]</span></p>

<p>“How far must I go to hit a jitney?”</p>

<p>“Main Street, two blocks east,” said the bartender
tersely.</p>

<p>“Don’t any of them go through this street?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes, but not regular. Mebbe, though,
that&mdash;&mdash;” The bartender stopped and looked searchingly
toward the restaurant, until his gaze fell upon
a man at one of the side tables. “Ah, there he is!
I thought he was there.”</p>

<p>“Thought who was here?”</p>

<p>“Toby Monk. He runs a jitney, but he is eating
his supper. His car may be outside.”</p>

<p>“Where does he leave it?”</p>

<p>“Just above here.”</p>

<p>“There is no car out there,” said Patsy. “I just
came in and would have seen it.”</p>

<p>“He’s put it up until later, then, as he often does
about this time.”</p>

<p>“It don’t matter,” said Patsy. “The walking’s
good.”</p>

<p>He turned away indifferently, and was pleased to
see that other customers then claimed the attention
of the bartender. Having carefully noted in which direction
he had gazed a moment before, Patsy easily
determined on which man his eyes had lingered, and
he now furtively sized him up&mdash;a well-built man in
the thirties, with a dark, smooth-shaven face, a square
jaw, and thin lips, having a downward curve that
gave him a sinister expression.</p>

<p>But Patsy’s train of thought was cut short when
Toby Monk, rising abruptly from a seat at the table,
took his cap from a wall rack and strode out through
the saloon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[175]</span></p>

<p>At the same moment a burly, red-featured man
entered from the street, and the two met just within
the swinging doors and scarce six feet from that end
of the bar at which Patsy was standing. He saw
Toby Monk start slightly, as if surprised, and then
heard him exclaim, with inquiring scrutiny:</p>

<p>“Hello! What’s up, Shannon?”</p>

<p>“Shannon!” Patsy echoed the name mentally, with
a thrill of increasing elation. “That’s the name of
the attendant the chief saw in Doctor Devoll’s private
room. He answers his description, too. Gee
whiz, the net is tightening for fair! It now is a cinch
that Doctor Devoll is one of the gang, and very possible
the big finger.”</p>

<p>Patsy missed nothing that was said while these
thoughts flashed through his mind. Shannon had
stopped short the moment he saw the chauffeur, to
whom he quickly replied, and with his gruff voice
only slightly subdued:</p>

<p>“You’re wanted, Toby.”</p>

<p>“Wanted by&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You know,” Shannon cut in quickly. “I have
orders for you.”</p>

<p>“What’s doing? Why did you come here after
me?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you on the way. This is no time or place.
Get a move on and go with me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you also if it’s all the same to you
two rascals&mdash;or whether it is or not,” thought Patsy
as he edged toward the door and followed the two
men to the street.</p>

</div>


<p>The trail picked up by Patsy Garvan was becoming
so hot, indeed, as he had expressed it, that he now
had absolutely no idea of quitting it. He followed
the two suspects through Prince Street, noting that
they were engaged in a subdued and very earnest discussion,
with Shannon doing most of the talking, but
Patsy did not venture to attempt overhearing them.</p>

<p>“I could pick up only a word or two at the most, and
must take a chance of being seen and suspected,” he
rightly reasoned. “That would put them on their
guard and knock a further espionage on the head. I’d
better keep them in the dark and try to see what’s
coming off. If Shannon brought orders from some
one to this sinister-looking scamp, it’s long odds that
Doctor Devoll was the one. There sure is something
in the wind.”</p>

<p>It soon was evident to him that the two men were
heading for the stable in which Toby Monk kept his
car, and he began to fear that he was booked for
the same difficulties he had had the previous night.
He felt quite sure of it, in fact, when both men entered
the stable and Toby Monk partly closed the
front door, precluding a view from the street.</p>

<p>Presently, however, a feeble light from a smoky lantern
could be seen, and Patsy muttered perplexedly:</p>

<p>“What do they want of that? They can’t be going
out with the car, after all, or a lantern would not<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
be needed. They may have come here only to escape
observation while planning a job. I can very soon
find out by making use of the back window again.”</p>

<p>He was on his way with the last thought. A couple
of minutes brought him to the back fence, over
which he climbed noiselessly, and then crept near
enough to see and hear through the dusty back window.</p>

<p>Toby Monk was on his knees with a box of blue
paste and a brush, engaged in altering the figures on
the rear number plate of the touring car.</p>

<p>Shannon was seated on a box near by, with his
brawny arms resting on his knees, while he grimly
watched the chauffeur’s artistic alterations.</p>

<p>“You’d better let the top down, too, Toby,” he advised,
after a moment. “That will help.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe so, Jim, since I’m never seen with it down,”
Monk replied. “I’ll drop it before leaving.”</p>

<p>“Besides, it might be a bit in the way,” Shannon
pointedly added. “It’s easier to get into an open
car. This trick has got to be turned on the jump, mind
you.”</p>

<p>“I know that, Jim, all right, and you can bet I’ll
do my part.”</p>

<p>“Have I made it perfectly plain to you?”</p>

<p>“As plain as twice two.”</p>

<p>“The signal&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There’s no need to repeat it, Jim,” Toby protested,
interrupting, much to Patsy’s disappointment. “I’ve
got the whole business down pat, so far as my part
in the job goes. You may tell his nibs he may bank
on that.”</p>

<p>“The hour&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[178]</span></p>

<p>“I know,” Monk again cut in impatiently. “You
need never repeat an order that he sends me. There’s
too much coming, Jim, for me to go lame.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be off, then, Toby, and tell him I found you,”
said Shannon, rising abruptly. “He’ll be waiting for
me by this time.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, then, and I’ll see you later.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing, Toby, bar a slip-up of some kind,”
Shannon paused to add. “You know what we are
up against.”</p>

<p>“Rats! Trust his nibs to get the best of that bunch.
No dicks can fool him. He’ll put something over on
them that they never heard of.”</p>

<p>Shannon laughed grimly, picking his way around
the touring car, and left the dingy, dimly lighted stable.</p>

<p>Patsy Garvan hesitated only for a moment. He remembered
the previous night. He knew that he might
find it utterly impossible to follow Toby Monk, who
evidently was soon going to use his car, and Patsy
immediately stole around the stable, taking advantage
of the darkness to dart back of the rear dwelling,
and in another moment he was stealthily following
Shannon up the street.</p>

<p>“Going to tell his nibs, is he?” thought Patsy, with
ever-increasing elation. “If I don’t learn who is back
of this whole business, then there’ll be something
wrong with the cards. Get the best of the chief, will
he? I guess not!”</p>

<p>He found it easy to shadow his unsuspecting
quarry. He trailed him to an outskirt of the business
section, where Shannon paused briefly in a gloomy
doorway and put on a disguise. Five minutes later,<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
after looking sharply in each direction, he entered a
court flanking one end of a large stone building.</p>

<p>“By gracious!” thought Patsy, gazing up at it.
“This is the Waldmere Chambers, the building in
which Todd was killed. Has the gang a headquarters
here, or is it where only the chief himself hangs
out? In either case, by Jove! I’m getting in right at
last.”</p>

<p>Stealing nearer, he peered cautiously into the court.
Shannon had disappeared in the deeper darkness. Following
noiselessly, Patsy brought up at a solid wooden
gate about six feet high, and he then heard a door
closed and the snap of a lock. It told him plainly
enough that Doctor David Devoll’s burly attendant
had entered the building.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! I must not lose track of him,” Patsy
muttered under his breath. “I’ll take chances to guard
against that. Locked, by thunder!”</p>

<p>Patsy had vainly tried to open the gate. He saw
that it closed an alley about five feet wide between
the rear of the Waldmere Chambers and the blank back
wall of another lofty building. He drew himself up
and looked over it. He could see a door some ten
feet away, and directly above it a single-lighted window,
the roller shade of which was drawn nearly to
the sill.</p>

<p>“That’s a rear office on the second floor,” Patsy
rightly reasoned. “That door must open into a basement,
however, for the land slopes toward the front
of the building. By Jove! I must find out what’s doing.”</p>

<p>Without a sound that could have been heard in
the office mentioned, he climbed over the gate and<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
dropped upon the pavement in the alley, then picked
his way through the gloom toward the door. He
then found that it was an ordinary storm door, opening
outward and protecting an interior one, which
was securely locked.</p>

<p>He listened vainly for any sound from within, also
at two ground-glass windows near by, evidently those
of a basement, then as dark as a pocket. Both were
securely fastened.</p>

<p>“Gee! I’m no better off,” he said to himself. “If
I could get up to that lighted window, I might learn
whether Shannon is there, or&mdash;by gum! I have it. I
can both see and hear, all right, by standing on the
top of this outer door. It’s some stunt to get up there,
though, without being heard.”</p>

<p>He demurred only briefly, seeing no other way to
accomplish his object. He opened the door, then hung
by his hands from the top for a moment, finding that
the hinges would support him. He then drew himself
up, working one leg over the outer corner, and
finally worming himself to a seat on the unsteady
perch. Twice he had swung against the building, but
met the wall noiselessly with his shoulder.</p>

<p>Reaching up, he then could grasp the stone sill of
the lighted window. He drew himself up, hanging
clear of the door, then nearly closed it with his feet,
bringing it to a position directly under the window,
enabling him to stand in a crouching posture on it,
still grasping the stone sill.</p>

<p>A beam of light from under the roller shade then
fell on Patsy’s grimly determined face. Voices from
within reached his ears. He peered into the room and<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
saw, seated in opposite chairs, Jim Shannon and Professor
Karl Graff.</p>

<p>“The man I trailed to Leary’s road house! The
man who killed the cat!” The thoughts flashed
swiftly through Patsy’s mind. “By gracious, it now
is a cinch! He’s the big finger of the gang. But who
the deuce is he?”</p>

<p>Though puzzled as to his identity, Patsy read plainly
in Professor Graff’s gray-bearded face that he was
discussing something of serious importance. His narrow
eyes had a vicious gleam and glitter. He was
drawn forward in his chair, with his hands clenched
on his knees and his gaze riveted on Shannon’s dark
face, from which he had removed his disguise.</p>

<p>“You made it clear to him, Jim, perfectly clear?”
Graff was asking. “There must be no mistake, no
delay.”</p>

<p>“There’ll be none,” Shannon gruffly informed him.
“You can bank on that.”</p>

<p>“The number plates&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I left him changing them.”</p>

<p>“The position he is to take with the car&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He knows the very spot.”</p>

<p>“The signal&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Your flash light&mdash;he knows,” Shannon cut in
again. “He’ll be watching for it.”</p>

<p>“And what he then must do?”</p>

<p>“The whole business. He has it down pat from
A to Z.”</p>

<p>Graff settled back in his chair. He appeared satisfied
with these forcible assurances. He fell to rubbing
his hands, his eyes gleaming with malicious triumph,<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
a gleam and glitter so intense that Patsy Garvan
felt that he was gazing at a madman.</p>

<p>“If he isn’t dippy, a pronounced victim of criminal
mania, I’m no judge of human faces,” he said to himself.
“Human be hanged! He has the look of a
devil, and all the makings of one, if I’m not mistaken.”</p>

<p>“We’ll balk him, thwart him, turn this trick on him,
Shannon, in spite of all he can do,” Graff snapped
viciously after a moment. “Then, if he dares to remain
in Madison&mdash;well, God help him! His fate
will be on his own head. I have told him. I have
warned him.”</p>

<p>“He means the chief,” thought Patsy. “This was
the rascal who sent him the letter, and he refers to
the theft of Mrs. Thurlow’s pearls. They’ve been
planning it, and that’s the job Toby Monk is booked
for to-night. If I can but learn the details of their
scheme, it will be soft walking for the chief to foil
their game and collar the entire gang. I’m on the
way, all right.”</p>

<p>Patsy felt reasonably sure of it, indeed, and he was
missing nothing that passed between the two conspirators.
Shannon appeared oblivious to Graff’s display
of feeling, though he smiled a bit grimly and
said:</p>

<p>“You can turn the dick down, all right, if need be,
and none would get wise. All I hope is that he won’t
be able to queer this job. There would be something
coming to us from it, a deal more than usual.”</p>

<p>“It’s as sure as if you already had it in your pocket,
Shannon, if my instructions are carefully followed.”</p>

<p>“They will be,” Shannon nodded. “What does Tim
Hurst think about it? Where does he fit in?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[183]</span></p>

<p>“He’s to work the trick with me.”</p>

<p>“Any one else?”</p>

<p>“Only Dorson.”</p>

<p>“Is it safe to rely upon him?”</p>

<p>“There will be no safety for him if he disappoints
me,” Graff declared, with vicious asperity. “He knows
what it will cost and that he’ll pay the price. You
know what befell the one treacherous cur who dared
to defy me and threatened to expose&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Enough of that,” Shannon cut in, with a growl.
“I don’t like to think of it, much less talk about it.
What has become of Hurst, anyway?”</p>

<p>“I have not seen him since last night, after he
searched the rooms of that servile cur.” Graff spoke
with an ugly snarl. “He found papers that would
have exposed us, but they now are ashes only. Luckily,
too, he was in time to down one of the Nick Carter
gang, who otherwise would have found the same
and had us by the ears.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get you all right, sooner or later,” thought
Patsy. “Tim Hurst, eh? The masked man whom
Chick encountered. Give us a little more time and
we’ll uncover all of these hidden faces.”</p>

<p>“Downed him, did he?” queried Shannon. “He
must be a lightweight dick that Tim could down, for
all he’s quick and clever.”</p>

<p>Professor Graff laughed for a moment as if much
tickled, but his mirth had qualities that sent a chill
down Patsy’s spine.</p>

<p>“I had made it easy for him,” Graff replied, still
chuckling with evil pride. “He wore an unsuspected
weapon, an electrical device of mine that would overcome<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
a horse. Let Tim alone to make good when
in a tight place.”</p>

<p>“But it’s near seven,” Shannon growled, glancing
at the clock. “If he’s to work with you to-night&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He’ll come,” Graff cut in quickly. “He’ll show up
on time. He’s due here now.”</p>

<p>“Due here! Will he sneak in this way, or enter
from the front street? If he comes while I’m up
here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Patsy caught his breath, scenting speedy trouble.</p>

<p>A key had been thrust into the lock, and almost
instantly the gate was opened and hurriedly closed.
A slender, black-clad figure had entered the alley, a
thin-featured, keen-eyed man of about thirty, who
quickly jerked the key from the lock.</p>

<p>Patsy had as quickly decided what he would do.
He knew he could not leap down from his unsteady
perch undetected and retreat farther into the alley.
He took, therefore, his only chance to escape observation,
knowing that he could not hold up the intruder
without alarming his confederates. Firmly
grasping the stone sill of the window, he drew up
his legs and raised his feet from the top of the door,
hoping the man would pass under him and enter without
seeing him.</p>

<p>The ruse came near proving successful. Tim Hurst
strode quickly to the storm door and flung it open, then
fished out a key to the inner one. He had heard
nothing alarming nor seen the crimped figure hanging
close to the dark wall directly above him.</p>

<p>Just then, however, a bit of cement broke from the
stone under Patsy’s rigid grasp, and it fell straight
down upon Hurst’s head. He drew back as if electrified,<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
looking up, and as quick as a flash he guessed
the truth. On the instant, too, while he uttered a
short, sharp whistle, he leaped up and seized Patsy’s
legs, snarling fiercely:</p>

<p>“Come down here! Let go, blast you, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Hurst was not given time to say more.</p>

<p>Patsy heard Graff and Shannon spring up and rush
down a back stairway in response to the whistle, and
he realized that only quick work could save him. He
let go of the sill and dropped straight down upon
Hurst’s head and shoulders, worming quickly around
as he pitched over him, and trying to grapple him
around his arms and waist.</p>

<p>The lithe and wiry rascal was alert, however, and
as quick of motion as a cat. He also twisted around
when Patsy fell, spreading his feet to steady himself,
and then, with a lightninglike lurch toward the building,
he brought Patsy’s head against the stone wall, a
blow that nearly cracked his skull and dazed him so
that he hardly knew what immediately followed.</p>

<p>In a vague way, however, he realized that he was
being roughly handled, that Graff and Shannon had
rushed out into the alley, and that the three men were
hurriedly taking him into the building.</p>

<p>He heard both doors closed and locked, then was
conscious of being placed roughly on a cold cement
floor, with two of the ruffians nearly crushing him in
the inky darkness. This was dispelled in a moment
by a glare of electric light, and the cobwebs then
had cleared from his brain sufficiently for him to size
up the surroundings.</p>

<p>He saw at a glance that he was in a chemical laboratory,
a large, square room with shelved walls, laden<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
with bottles, jars, carboys, and the like. A zinc-covered
table was littered with the customary articles
required by a chemist. There was a closet in one corner.
Near by was an open door, an adjoining entry,
and a narrow stairway leading up to the room in which
the two men had been seated.</p>

<p>Patsy still was gazing around when Graft approached
him, commanding his two confederates to
bind him, which they quickly proceeded to do with
cords brought from the closet, while Tim Hurst hurriedly
stated where he discovered their captive.</p>

<p>“Who are you? Who sent you here to play the
spy?” he fiercely questioned.</p>

<p>Though he keenly realized that he was in wrong,
and that much of his good work might prove futile,
Patsy lost neither his head nor his nerve.</p>

<p>“No one sent me,” he answered curtly. “I came
on my own hook.”</p>

<p>“You lie!” Graff snapped harshly. “You are in
Nick Carter’s employ.”</p>

<p>“By Heaven, I guess that’s right,” Shannon agreed,
with a snarl. “He’s one of the dicks.”</p>

<p>“We’ll dick him! We’ll dick him all right when
the time comes,” Graff fiercely declared. “But not
now, not yet. The Thurlow pearls are of first importance,
and I have only time to prepare for that
job. We’ll settle with him later. Gag him, Shannon,
and lock him in the closet. You must wait here and
watch till we return. Make sure the whelp can’t
escape. I’ll fix him later. I’ll fix him.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” thought Patsy. “If he makes good
as he looks, I can see my finish.”</p>

</div>


<p>Nick Carter wore a worried look at eight o’clock
that evening. Both he and Chick then were dressing
for the elaborate reception and ball tendered to
the local National Guards, generally admitted to be
the chief social event slated for that season in Madison,
and during which the unknown crook whom the
detectives were so anxious to identify had threatened
to commit the crime the latter were grimly determined
to prevent.</p>

<p>Nick Carter’s anxiety, however, was not because
his life also had been threatened and might possibly
be taken, in case he became an insurmountable obstacle
to the designs of the mysterious and daring desperado.
He was thinking of Patsy Garvan, his prolonged absence,
the occasion for which he could not fathom,
knowing that Patsy ordinarily would have reported
by telephone, at least, in view of the work engaging
him, unless something very unexpected and equally
serious prevented him.</p>

<p>The detective did not blind himself, moreover, to
the fact that his own designs had been repeatedly anticipated
and balked by the unknown knave or by
members of his gang, in spite of his own expeditious
work and the precautions he had taken. He realized
most keenly that he was up against a remarkably
crafty and resourceful scoundrel. He began to fear
that Patsy had fallen into his hands and, in spite of<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
his confidence in his own skill and prowess, that he
also might be booked for failure and utterly unable
to prevent the threatened theft of Mrs. Mortimer
Thurlow’s pearls.</p>

<p>“It would be perfectly easy to foil the rascals, if that
was all we wished to accomplish,” said the detective,
while he and Chick were discussing their plans. “But
that is not enough.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” declared Chick. “We must take
advantage of the circumstances to discover their identity
and in some way contrive to arrest them.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. We must allow them enough leeway,
therefore, to be sure they will attempt the crime,”
Carter pointed out. “They know what they are up
against and that we are out to get them. If we remain
too near to Mrs. Thurlow, as if ready to instantly
grab any one that lays a finger on her, there
will be nothing to it. The miscreants will throw
up the job.”</p>

<p>“Surely,” Chick agreed. “No sane man would
attempt it under such conditions.”</p>

<p>“The fact that we are carefully disguised, moreover,
would not deceive them. They would suspect
any men who constantly hung around within reach
of Mrs. Thurlow, and would very soon identify us.
We must give them enough leeway, therefore, as I
have said, to be sure they will make the attempt.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” Chick nodded.</p>

<p>“It goes without saying, nevertheless, that we must
be in a position to constantly watch the woman,” Carter
added. “Having no idea just when the theft may
be attempted, we must not lose sight of her for a moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[189]</span></p>

<p>“What plan had we better adopt?”</p>

<p>“We can lay no elaborate plan. It will be of advantage,
however, if we keep an eye on one another,
as well as on the woman, and contrive to keep her constantly
between us. That will enable us to head off
a thief in two directions, at least.”</p>

<p>“I see the point.”</p>

<p>“We must be alert, also, to detect any person whose
looks or actions warrant suspicion,” Carter continued.
“It is barely possible that one of us can discover the
crook before the theft is attempted.”</p>

<p>“I’ll put you wise, chief, in that case, and you do
the same.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p>“Her nephew is to be her escort, you say.”</p>

<p>“Yes. His name is Dorson. He will accompany
both Mrs. Thurlow and her daughter, and we can
identify them when they arrive.”</p>

<p>“And our work must begin at that moment.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Naturally, of course, Dorson will pay
considerable attention to Mrs. Thurlow, and I don’t
think his presence will deter the crooks, for I have
directed her to say nothing to him about expecting a
crime. There is no occasion for any one to suspect
him, of course, even though he is with her much of
the time.”</p>

<p>The detective added the last while they were about
to leave. It was a perfectly natural supposition, of
course, that the man of whom he was speaking was
entirely trustworthy. He did not have a thought to
the contrary, and, therefore, he could not foresee the
fatal result of this misplaced confidence in Mr. John
Dorson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[190]</span></p>

<p>It was a brilliant scene upon which the two detectives
arrived soon after eight o’clock, which they knew
would be sufficiently early. The streets adjoining
the park in which the handsome new armory building
was situated, in the vast hall and drill room, on the
second floor of which the ball was to be held, were
crowded with costly, brightly lighted automobiles of
nearly every type, leaving as rapidly as possible a
throng of fashionably clad men and elaborately
gowned women, many lavishly adorned with radiant
gems and jewels.</p>

<p>Fortune favored the detectives at first. They had
been waiting only a few minutes in the broad reception
hall on the ground floor, when Carter saw Mrs.
Thurlow and Edna arrive in company with a tall,
somewhat cadaverous man, who he knew must be Mr.
John Dorson.</p>

<p>“There they are, Chick,” he said quietly. “The
woman has not weakened. She is doing her part,
indeed, to help us nail our man. She is wearing the
rope of pearls.”</p>

<p>“Some pearls, too,” Chick muttered admiringly.
“By Jove! they warrant taking a desperate chance.
That tall fellow is Dorson, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Surely.”</p>

<p>“He’s not very attractive. He has the look of a
rounder.”</p>

<p>“Not as bad as that, I guess,” said Carter. “I think
Mrs. Thurlow would have told me. Step down that
way and keep an eye on her. We now must watch
her constantly.”</p>

<p>Both had been standing in an alcove formed by the rise
of the broad, main stairway. The latter led up<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
to a wide corridor flanking three sides of the ballroom,
which was accessible from each through several broad,
pillared doorways. In the end wall of the room was
a row of open French windows, leading out upon the
balcony roof of a wide veranda overlooking an avenue
through the park mentioned, in which numerous automobiles
already had gathered to await the end of the
festivities.</p>

<p>One among them had arrived quite early and obtained
a position of special advantage, close to the
broad avenue and within easy view of the veranda and
balcony. It attracted no more attention than any of
the others, neither did the chauffeur, who sat motionless
at his wheel. None would have recognized his
bearded face, nor could the car have been traced from
the license number it then appeared to bear.</p>

<p>It was to these conditions and surroundings that
Professor Karl Graff had referred while talking with
Dorson in the road house, and of which he and his
knavish confederates were prepared to take every
advantage.</p>

<p>Chick slipped away from his chief, as the latter had
directed, and took a position from which he could
watch the door of a room to which Mrs. Thurlow
and Edna had gone to leave their outside garments,
while Dorson hastened to another to check his crush
hat and Inverness. Though his face was unusually
pale and grave, it wore no expression inviting suspicion.</p>

<p>He returned in a few moments and rejoined Edna
Thurlow, departing with her through the throng in
the lower corridor and mingling with the stream of
wealth and fashion then seeking the ballroom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[192]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Thurlow came out a little later and joined a
group of women acting as a reception committee, and
for nearly an hour she remained in the lower hall,
apparently undisturbed by the threats of which she
had been informed, and conducting herself precisely as
if ignorant of them, as Carter had directed.</p>

<p>Both detectives, though they then were separated,
had an eye on her all the while and on the rope of lustrous
pearls adorning her shapely neck and perfect
shoulders. Neither could detect any person near her
inviting suspicion, however, and it really seemed improbable
that so daring a theft could be successfully
committed, in view of the fact that it had been predicted
and prevention audaciously invited.</p>

<p>It was ten o’clock when Mrs. Thurlow went up to
the lavishly decorated ballroom. There, and in the
adjoining corridors, a throng of several hundred
guests were assembled. A dance then was in progress,
however, and the corridors were less crowded than
during the intervals between the dances.</p>

<p>Carter and Chick met on the stairs while following
the woman quite closely, and Carter said a bit hurriedly,
noting the direction she was taking:</p>

<p>“She’s going to that end of the hall overlooking the
balcony. I’ll follow her. You hurry around through
the corridor, so as to watch her from the opposite
side of the hall. We then will have her guarded from
both directions.”</p>

<p>“Suppose she goes out on the balcony?”</p>

<p>“Slip out through one of the other windows. You
must not lose sight of her.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got you,” Chick muttered, as he turned at
the head of the stairs and hurried away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[193]</span></p>

<p>Carter followed the woman in the opposite direction,
admiring her outward composure and the nerve
she was displaying. He saw her enter the last of the
broad doors and thread her way by the throng of
dancers, finally halting near one of the windows leading
out to the balcony, where she was immediately
joined by a colonel of the Guards, in full-dress uniform,
and a lady, with whom he had been dancing.</p>

<p>Carter paused in the broad doorway, with a quick
and searching glance in each direction. He caught
sight of Chick, just entering a door directly across the
broad, brightly lighted hall. He saw Edna Thurlow
amid the throng of dancers, and noticed that she was
pale and paying little attention to the remarks of her
partner. He saw, too, the tall form of Mr. John
Dorson, who then was standing alone near the second
window beyond that near which Mrs. Thurlow had
halted.</p>

<p>Though none could know it save the miscreant who
had planned the daring job, the situation then was
one for which he had been waiting, the crucial moment
when conditions assured him of success, when
the avenue fronting the veranda was unobstructed,
when flight would be easy, when the throng in the
ballroom were absorbed in the dance, when the strains
of orchestral music drowned all other sounds, and
when the victim of his designs had paused at a time
and place that perfectly served his purpose.</p>

<p>Two inconspicuous, bearded men in evening dress,
who had apparently been talking carelessly on the balcony,
suddenly separated.</p>

<p>One of them glided quickly toward the window<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
near which Mrs. Thurlow was standing, taking a position
close against the wall.</p>

<p>The other moved in the opposite direction, stopping
short near the second window and taking a small
electric flash light from his pocket. Hooding it with
both hands, so that its glare might not be observed
by any of the persons then on the balcony, he lighted
the lens for a moment, so holding it that it could be
seen from the grounds, on which motionless motor
cars then were parked.</p>

<p>The signal was answered almost instantly. The
lamps of one of the motionless motor cars shot a
quick glare outward over the avenue, and in another
moment it was moving moderately in that direction.</p>

<p>The man with a searchlight turned quickly and entered
the French window. He passed directly back of
Dorson, and, without stopping, whispered hurriedly:</p>

<p>“Now, Dorson, be quick! Get in your work!”</p>

<p>Dorson started as if stung. He did not recognize
the bearded man, but there was no mistaking his voice,
that fierce, sibilant hiss that he had heard at the road
house&mdash;the threatening voice of Professor Karl Graff.</p>

<p>Dorson instantly pulled himself together, nevertheless,
and nerved himself for what he had undertaken.
He took the celluloid box from his pocket,
concealing it in his hand, and removed the cover, at
the same time walking toward Mrs. Thurlow, at whom
he had been gazing when he heard Graff’s threatening
command.</p>

<p>When nearly back of her, Dorson stooped to the
floor and pretended to pick up a handkerchief&mdash;which
he had deftly removed from the box, quickly replacing
the latter in his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[195]</span></p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said he, stepping in front of her.
“You have dropped your handkerchief, Aunt Clara.”</p>

<p>The colonel talking with her turned at once to his
partner, and they whirled away amid other dancing
couples.</p>

<p>“My handkerchief, Jack?” Mrs. Thurlow took it, but
with a look of surprise.</p>

<p>“I think so.” Dorson drew back a step and with
one hand covered his mouth and nostrils.</p>

<p>“No, this is not mine. You are mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure, Aunt Clara? It was on the floor
behind you. I thought you had dropped it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thurlow bowed her head a little closer to examine
it, still much crumpled, unfolding it and seeking
an initial.</p>

<p>“No, it is not mine, Jack,” she repeated. “It may
be marked, however, or&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her voice suddenly died away to a whisper. She
looked up at Dorson, as if strangely dazed, and he
saw her eyes quickly taking on the vacant expression
that had been predicted, the pupils contracting to mere
pinpoints, abnormally bright, while her lips turned
from red to a dull gray.</p>

<p>Though his every nerve was quivering with secret
terror, Dorson kept his head and continued to play his
part. He instantly took the woman’s arm, saying
quietly:</p>

<p>“You are pale and look tired. Step out on the balcony
with me. The air will revive you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thurlow obeyed him as if in a trance or a victim
of an hypnotic spell. She walked out with him
through the French window. There was a large
wicker chair near by, and Dorson placed her in it, then<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
whisked the fateful handkerchief from her fingers and
thrust it into his pocket. Then he hurried back into
the ballroom, through which he passed as if in haste
to obtain water, as he really was.</p>

<p>The man lurking near the wall in the dim light
instantly approached the woman. Pausing beside her
chair, he bowed as if to converse with her. His keen,
black eyes shot one swift glance at a few persons on
a remote part of the balcony. None was observing
him. His deft hands quickly lifted the rope of pearls
and dropped it into his pocket. Then he took out a
small glass vial, poured the contents of it upon a
sponge, and held the latter to the woman’s nostrils for
a few seconds.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thurlow gasped and caught her breath.</p>

<p>The man accidentally dropped the vial and it rolled
out of sight. He did not wait to search for it, did not
dare to delay his departure. He walked quickly toward
a corner of the balcony, where the top of a vine-covered
trellis rose just above the railing.</p>

<p>Toby Monk was at that moment passing the corner
with his motor car.</p>

<p>Both Nick Carter and Chick had witnessed the episode
in the ballroom, and the same thought arose in
the minds of both&mdash;that Mrs. Thurlow was perfectly
safe while with her nephew.</p>

<p>The moment that Dorson returned alone, however,
both detectives felt a quick thrill of suspicion, an instinctive
feeling that the fateful moment had arrived,
and both hurried toward the nearest of the French
windows, making their way as quickly as possible
through the maze of whirling dancers.</p>

<p>Chick was the first to reach the balcony. Coming<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
from the glare in the ballroom, he could not immediately
see the seated woman in the dim light outside.
He discovered her in a moment, however, and ran toward
her&mdash;just as his chief hurriedly approached from
the opposite direction.</p>

<p>One glance at Mrs. Thurlow’s white face, at her vacant
eyes and lax figure, at the neck, then bare of its
lustrous adornment&mdash;one glance was enough.</p>

<p>“By thunder, they’ve turned the trick!” Chick cried,
staring. “That man Dorson must&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Carter did not wait to hear him. He had swung
around like a flash, seeking the thief, knowing that
scarce a minute had passed since the woman left the
ballroom. The few persons then on the balcony had
not observed any disturbance, but the detective instantly
caught sight of the swaying top of the trellis
mentioned.</p>

<p>He ran in that direction, reaching for his revolver,
but he arrived at the corner of the balcony rail only
in time to see a slender, black-clad figure leap into
a moving motor car, that instantly sped away down
the avenue&mdash;Tim Hurst, with the rope of pearls in his
pocket.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">WHERE THE TIDE TURNED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Nick Carter did not attempt to stop the fleeing
crooks. He saw that the avenue was unobstructed,
that the motor car already was attaining high speed,
that a shot from his revolver would probably be
wasted, and that pursuit was utterly out of the question.
He turned back and hastened to rejoin Chick&mdash;just
as Jack Dorson returned from the ballroom,
bringing a glass of water.</p>

<p>Chick was the first to see him, and, having at once
suspected him of aiding the crooks, he impulsively
started to call him down.</p>

<p>“See here!” he exclaimed. “What motive did you
have in bringing this woman&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A glass of water! Presumably, of course, because
Mrs. Thurlow wanted it. She must have felt ill, for
she appears to have fainted.”</p>

<p>Carter had cut in quickly with the interruption, but
with a blandness that at once told Chick that he did
not want his suspicions revealed to Dorson, and he
immediately permitted his chief to take the ribbons.</p>

<p>The entire episode had transpired in far less time
than is required to describe it. Scarce three minutes
had passed since Professor Karl Graff, most skillfully
disguised, an art in which his proficiency soon will become
obvious, had seen the opportunity for which he
had been waiting.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thurlow was beginning to recover, nevertheless,<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
though still too dazed to realize what had occurred.
But the stimulant or counteracting agent held
to her nostrils by Tim Hurst, even while he robbed
her of her pearls, was rapidly reviving her&mdash;as rapidly
as in the case of the girl on a cot in the Osgood
Hospital.</p>

<p>Nick had glanced in Dorson’s direction when interrupting
his assistant, and in the light shed through
the French window he caught sight of something glistening
back of Mrs. Thurlow’s chair. He picked it
up and slipped it into his pocket&mdash;the vial accidentally
dropped by Tim Hurst in his hasty departure.</p>

<p>Though the stir had been noticed by a few of the
persons on the balcony, none supposed that a robbery
had been committed, and none had approached to aid
or interfere.</p>

<p>Jack Dorson saw at a glance that the rope of pearls
was gone, however, and, with nerves now as tense as
bowstrings, he quickly took advantage of the detective’s
remarks, not for a moment dreaming that they
had been designedly made.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, she said she felt faint,” he replied, holding
the glass of water to his aunt’s lips. “I noticed in
the ballroom that she was quite pale. I had picked
up her handkerchief, or one I supposed was hers.”</p>

<p>“I happened to see you,” Carter nodded. “Wasn’t
it hers?”</p>

<p>“She said not.”</p>

<p>“It appears to be missing.”</p>

<p>“She must have dropped it again.”</p>

<p>“Very likely.”</p>

<p>“I told her she had better come out in the air,”
Dorson was explaining very glibly, each moment feeling<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
more sure of successfully hiding his guilt. “I
came with her and placed her in this chair, and she
then asked me to bring her some water.”</p>

<p>“Exactly.” Carter agreed with him readily. “I
saw you returning hurriedly, and I thought there
might be something wrong. That’s why I came out
here.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” Dorson now exclaimed, as if suddenly
alarmed. “There is something wrong. See?
Her rope of pearls is gone. She was wearing it when
I left her.”</p>

<p>“It may have unclasped and fallen to the floor,” the
detective said quickly. “Look around. Try to find
it.”</p>

<p>Dorson obeyed with alacrity, thinking it the most
consistent course for one anxious to appear entirely
innocent, and Chick hastened to assist him in the
search, now seeing plainly that his chief had some
covert object in the negative steps he was taking.</p>

<p>Carter had seen, just as the theft of the pearls was
mentioned, that Mrs. Thurlow was sufficiently recovered
to appreciate the loss and also the mystifying
situation. She had started up in her chair, and was
feeling with frantic haste for the stolen treasure, when
Carter bent nearer and grasped her arm, unobserved
by the others.</p>

<p>“Collect yourself and listen,” he whispered impressively.
“I am Nick Carter, disguised. The pearls are
gone, but that is part of the game I am playing. They
will be returned to you to-morrow. Say not a word
about me, not even to your nephew. I will return
the pearls to you to-morrow evening.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[201]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t oppose me,” Carter forcibly insisted. “Do
only what I direct. All depends upon it. Tell Edna
not to mention me in the hearing of others. Pretend,
now, that you have been robbed and that I am a
stranger.”</p>

<p>The scene that immediately followed, for Mrs.
Thurlow understood and yielded to him, was about
what he expected, and also what he wanted. Amid
the ensuing stir and confusion, for an excited throng
gathered as soon as the robbery was announced, he
informed Dorson that he would go and notify the
police, and in company with Chick he immediately departed.</p>

<p>Not until they were on their way down the avenue,
however, did Chick make any comments or ask any
questions. He then began with saying a bit disgustedly:</p>

<p>“We seem to be playing a losing game. Is that the
size of it, chief, or what have you up your sleeve?”</p>

<p>“The crooks have the rope of pearls,” Carter replied,
with grim dryness. “There is no denying that.”</p>

<p>“And we are beaten to a frazzle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, not quite as bad as that,” the detective
quickly protested. “We are not done brown, Chick,
by any means.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Do you suspect Dorson?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly. It was he who made the crime
possible. He was coöperating with the rascals who
did the more hazardous work.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I suspected.”</p>

<p>“It’s as plain as twice two, Chick, in view of what
we know about the girls found unconscious in the
hospital grounds. The handkerchief used by Dorson<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
was impregnated with the same mysterious substance
with which the girls were temporarily overcome. Obviously,
too, the crook who got the pearls administered
the antidote or Mrs. Thurlow would not have revived
so quickly.”</p>

<p>“The same antidote that restored the four girls.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly. Those were experimental cases,
Chick, as sure as I’m a foot high, in anticipation of
this job. Doctor Devoll was trying out his narcotic,
so to speak.”</p>

<p>“You still think he is the chief culprit, the man behind
the gun?”</p>

<p>“He was in every instance the man who revived
the girls, the physician who appeared to perfectly understand
each case.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” Chick nodded. “I see the point.
But why did you conceal your suspicions from Dorson?”</p>

<p>“Because nothing could be gained by revealing
them.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, also. Wouldn’t it be well to shadow
him, in case he&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not at present,” Carter interrupted. “He will
make no immediate move. All that he said was,
plainly enough, designed to avert suspicion from himself,
and he will continue to conduct himself along the
same line for a time. We may get him later.”</p>

<p>“But what are your plans? Where are you going?”
Chick impatiently questioned. “Great Scott! we must
get on the track of those pearls.”</p>

<p>“I’m on their track, all right,” his chief said grimly.
“More surely on their track than at any stage of the<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
game. I told Mrs. Thurlow that I would return them
to her to-morrow evening.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” Chick gazed at him, surprised.
“Wasn’t that a rather chesty prediction?”</p>

<p>“Quite so, Chick, but, having got the worst of it, I
had to keep her quiet till I could get the best of it.”</p>

<p>“There’s something in that.”</p>

<p>“Besides, I expect to have recovered them by that
time.”</p>

<p>“Why so? I thought you had something up your
sleeve.”</p>

<p>“It is in my pocket,” Carter corrected dryly.</p>

<p>He took it out; the vial he had picked up unobserved
by others. Displaying it between his thumb
and fingers, he told Chick where he had found it; then
added pointedly:</p>

<p>“It will help some.”</p>

<p>“You mean&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I mean that I now intend to corner Doctor David
Devoll,” Carter interrupted. “It now is ten o’clock.
Before this time to-morrow, Chick, I’ll have Devoll
where the wool is short. Take my word for it.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE WHEEL WITHIN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Nick Carter finished his breakfast at eight o’clock
the following morning. He needed no one to tell him
that Patsy Garvan, who still was absent, had fallen
into the hands of the remarkably clever and thus far
successful gang he was seeking. It was only half an
hour later when Carter entered the Osgood Hospital,
where he was received in the business office by Jim
Shannon, then in his customary livery.</p>

<p>“Doctor Devoll is not here, sir,” he said respectfully,
in reply to the detective’s question. “He seldom
comes here before noon. He has outside patients,
sir, and other business. You might catch him before
he goes out, sir, if your business is important.”</p>

<p>“Out from where?” Carter asked curtly.</p>

<p>“From his apartments, sir. He has a suite in the
Pemberton.”</p>

<p>“Where is that?”</p>

<p>“About ten minutes’ walk from here,” Shannon said
suavely. “I can find out for you, sir, whether he is
there.”</p>

<p>“By telephone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do so,” the detective said shortly.</p>

<p>He sat down and kept an eye on the man, who did
not appear in the least disturbed by the detective’s
visit. One less quick to suspect subterfuge would have
apprehended that his suspicions were misplaced, that<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
Shannon knew nothing about the anonymous letter,
and that Doctor Devoll was not the sender of it, after
all.</p>

<p>Nick Carter, however, had no such apprehension.
He knew that he was up against as cool and crafty a
gang of knaves as ever stood in leather. He now was
accepting nothing that appeared on the surface. He
was seeking the wheel within.</p>

<p>He watched and listened while Shannon telephoned,
readily getting Doctor Devoll on the wire and stating
that Mr. Blaisdell, who had called the previous day,
would like to come to the Pemberton to see him. That
was all that Shannon said, noncommittal it was, too,
and he immediately hung up the receiver and turned
to the detective.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, Doctor Devoll is there, and it’s all right,”
he said, with the air of one glad to have conferred
a favor. “He will wait for you. You can go right
up.”</p>

<p>Nick took all this for what he thought it was worth.
He lingered only to inquire the way, then turned on
his heel and departed.</p>

<p>Shannon watched him hasten across Hamilton
Square, and then, with a scowl as black as a thunder-cloud,
he darted to the telephone.</p>

<p>Ten minutes had passed when the detective knocked
on the door of a second-floor suite in the Pemberton,
and he was immediately admitted by the man he was
seeking.</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll looked more lean and bald than usual
in the sunlight shed into his attractively furnished
parlor. He wore a short, velvet jacket, his customary<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
black vest and trousers, and he greeted the detective
with an ingratiating smile.</p>

<p>“Come in, Mr. Blaisdell, and take a seat,” he said,
waving Carter to a chair. “I remembered your visit,
of course, when Shannon called me up. You were very
lucky, however, in finding me this morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” queried Carter tentatively.</p>

<p>“I usually leave here about half past eight, but I
overslept this morning. I was very busy at the hospital
all of last evening, and did not retire till after
midnight.”</p>

<p>“A serious case or an operation?”</p>

<p>“Neither. I was doing some writing in my private
room, with the help of my attendant,” Doctor Devoll
explained blandly. Then he added, with a covert leer
deep down in his squinted eyes: “But it’s an ill wind,
indeed, that blows no one any good. What can I
do for you, Mr. Blaisdell?”</p>

<p>Nick Carter heard him without a change of countenance,
but with no faith in the alibi so quickly volunteered.
He remembered the location of the physician’s
room, the strict privacy that was possible, and his
grounds for having suspected Shannon of duplicity.
He felt sure that they already had framed up a story
to show, if it became necessary, that they were not on
the scene of the robbery the previous evening.</p>

<p>“You can, I think, give me some very desirable information,”
Carter replied, with steadfast scrutiny.
“Speaking of doing some writing, Doctor Devoll, have
a look at this anonymous letter. Read it, please, and
tell me what you think of it.”</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll took it, smiling, and glanced at the
address.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[207]</span></p>

<p>“Dear me!” he exclaimed, looking up quickly. “It
is addressed to Nick Carter.”</p>

<p>“I am Nick Carter.”</p>

<p>“The famous detective?”</p>

<p>“I am a detective.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, this is most surprising.” Devoll appeared
greatly astonished. “I thought your name was
Blaisdell. Why are you using a fictitious name?
What could&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I will presently explain,” Nick interrupted.
“Kindly read the letter.”</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll complied. Nothing denoted that he
was reading his own threatening letter. His crafty
face took on, instead, a look of mingled wonderment
and indignation.</p>

<p>“Goodness!” said he, gazing straight at Nick. “This
is most amazing. A robbery predicted and your life
threatened. What audacity! What daring knavery!”</p>

<p>“I agree with you.”</p>

<p>“Do you know who sent it or suspect?”</p>

<p>“I do not. Can you help me?”</p>

<p>“Help you? What a question! Why had you any
such idea?” Doctor Devoll demanded, frowning. “I
cannot imagine who would send you such a letter.”</p>

<p>“I thought you might know the hand.”</p>

<p>“It is not familiar to me. Why did you think so?”</p>

<p>“I will presently tell you,” said Carter. “The sender
has in one respect made good. Mrs. Thurlow’s rope
of pearls was stolen last evening.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, is it possible?” Devoll’s brows rose
again with a look of surprise. “In that case, Mr.
Carter, you have only one course.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[208]</span></p>

<p>“That stated in this anonymous letter. No sane
man would ignore such a warning. Leave Madison
as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the sender may
again make good and kill you. I would advise you to
lose no time in returning to New York.”</p>

<p>“I shall do nothing of the kind.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“I shall remain in Madison until I have stuffed that
letter down the sender’s throat.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s up to you, of course, and I admire
your nerve.” Doctor Devoll smiled again and returned
the letter. “It strikes me, however, that you will take
a desperate chance, a foolhardy one, in view of the
threat that has been executed. I would expect, if I
were in your shoes, to have my head blown off at any
moment.”</p>

<p>“I’ll risk it.”</p>

<p>“As I have said, then, it’s up to you.” Doctor Devoll
drew forward in his chair and spread his hands
on his knees. “But why have you called to show me
the letter, and what do you expect to learn from me?
I know nothing about it or about the theft of the
pearls.”</p>

<p>Nick glanced down at the physician’s hands. He
noticed that they were white and slender, that the
nails were neatly manicured, and that that on his right
thumb was a bit discolored, as if from a slight bruise.
He looked up and replied:</p>

<p>“On the contrary, Doctor Devoll, you do know
something about the theft.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Just what I said.”</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll did not reply immediately. He sat<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
meeting the detective’s searching scrutiny without a
sign of flinching. His narrowed eyes were taking on
a threatening glint, instead, and he said a bit sharply:</p>

<p>“If you repeat that assertion, Mr. Carter, I will
order you out of my apartments. I insist that I know
nothing about that letter or about the robbery. If
you think I am lying&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“One moment,” Nick interposed, checking him.
“Don’t misunderstand me or go over the traces. You
will presently agree with me, Doctor Devoll.”</p>

<p>“Agree with you?”</p>

<p>“You have not forgotten, of course, the four girls
found unconscious in the hospital grounds.”</p>

<p>“No, certainly not.”</p>

<p>“You treated all of them successfully, but you let
them go without making an investigation. Now,
Doctor Devoll, I happen to know that their abnormal
condition was due to inhaling a powerful narcotic of
some kind from a handkerchief found in a small
leather purse or bag.”</p>

<p>“Ah! You know more about it, then, than I do.”</p>

<p>“I know, too, that Mrs. Thurlow was overcome by
like means and robbed. I also know that the thief administered
an antidote that soon revived her&mdash;presumably
the same antidote that you administered to
the four girls. That is why I said that you know
something, at least, about the robbery.”</p>

<p>“You mean&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I mean that you know, of course, of what the antidote
consists,” Nick cut in again. “Otherwise, you
would not have used it. That is a logical conclusion,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[210]</span></p>

<p>“Perfectly&mdash;if your premises are correct.”</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll did not appear at all disturbed. If
these unexpected discoveries of the detective alarmed
him, he did not betray the fact. Only the gleam that
shone in his narrow eyes was steadily becoming
brighter&mdash;and Nick saw and rightly interpreted it.</p>

<p>“They are correct, doctor, all right,” he replied
a bit grimly. “If you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wait!” Doctor Devoll spoke more suavely. “I
now see what you meant, Mr. Carter, and at what
you are driving. I beg to assure you, too, that I would
be very glad to aid you in this matter or give you any
information I possess.”</p>

<p>“I had no doubt of that, of course,” Nick said dryly.</p>

<p>“I hope not.” Doctor Devoll smiled again. “But
why do you infer that the restorative I used was the
same as that given to Mrs. Thurlow. I may have employed
only an ordinary stimulant.”</p>

<p>“I doubt that an ordinary stimulant would have been
effective,” the detective returned. “Furthermore, a
policeman who was present in the case of the last girl
saw you saturate a sponge with an amber-colored fluid
poured from a small fluted vial. Here is one like it,
Doctor Devoll. You may recognize it.”</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll’s nerve did not weaken for an instant.
He merely glanced at the vial Nick was displaying,
and said blandly:</p>

<p>“You should not have said recognize it, Mr. Carter,
for that implies ownership. I never saw that vial before.
I admit, however, that I have one precisely like
it.”</p>

<p>“And that it contained the antidote you used?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[211]</span></p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know?” Nick echoed incredulously. “Do
you mean to assert, Doctor Devoll, that you blindly
used&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I admit that it sounds incredible,” Doctor Devoll
interrupted. “It is true, sir, nevertheless. The
vial and its contents were given to me by a friend, a
chemist in whom I have absolute confidence, with directions
how and in what cases to use it. I tried it
successfully on the first of the four girls, and I since
have repeatedly used it. I have not yet learned, however,
what ingredients the fluid contained or how it is
compounded.”</p>

<p>“Speaking plainly, Doctor Devoll, that story&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see you are still incredulous,” the physician
again interrupted. “It is not surprising, Mr. Carter,
under the circumstances. But there is one way to
settle it. You can easily verify my statements. Go
with me to my friend and he will corroborate&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Where must we go?” the detective cut in.</p>

<p>“Not far. He has an office and laboratory in the
Waldmere Chambers.”</p>

<p>“H’m, is that so? Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Professor Karl Graff.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” Nick ejaculated. “I remember him.”</p>

<p>He now recalled for the first time, in fact, the
elderly man who had approached from the rear of the
corridor in which the corpse of the mysteriously murdered
Gaston Todd was lying. He remembered the
negative statements this man had made. He recalled,
too, Patsy Garvan’s description of the gray-bearded<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
man seen at Leary’s road house and the mysterious
killing of Leary’s cat. All this flashed upon him with
sudden startling significance, giving color to the physician’s
story&mdash;though Nick decided to keep an eye
on him.</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” he said abruptly. “Get ready
at once. We will go together and see him.”</p>

<p>Doctor Devoll complied with alacrity. A leer lurked
in his eyes when he hastened into his bedroom. He
quickly returned, wearing his black frock coat and
tall silk hat.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Carter, I am ready,” he said, smiling.
“I will speedily set myself right in your estimation.”</p>

<p>Nick had convictions to the contrary, but he did
not express them. In reality, nevertheless, he was
considerably puzzled by the increasing complications,
and he began to suspect that Professor Karl Graff
might be the guilty man, after all&mdash;the discoverer of
the potent narcotic that had made possible the long
series of mysterious crimes.</p>

<p>It was ten o’clock when they entered the Waldmere
Chambers and hastened up to the second-floor corridor,
toward the rear of which Doctor Devoll conducted
the detective, remarking agreeably:</p>

<p>“This way to Professor Graff’s office. We are old
friends, and I frequently call here to see him. I have
known him for years.”</p>

<p>Carter followed him, with a glance at the spot where
Gaston Todd had been found dead, scarcely twenty
feet from the door opened by the physician. He led
the detective in, and a man arose from a table at which
he appeared to have been at work&mdash;Tim Hurst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[213]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, good morning, doctor,” he said respectfully,
hastening to place chairs for both visitors.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Tim,” Doctor Devoll said familiarly.
“Is Karl in his laboratory?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.” Hurst appeared as frank as a schoolboy.
“He has not come down yet. He has not been
coming in much before noon lately, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, I can expedite matters,” Devoll said
glibly. “Sit down, Mr. Carter, while I ring him up.
His telephone is in the laboratory.”</p>

<p>He passed out of a side door while speaking, and
Nick did not detain him, supposing he had merely
entered an adjoining room. The door closed automatically.
Tim Hurst tendered a morning newspaper,
asking politely:</p>

<p>“Have you read the news, sir? There was another
robbery last night, Mrs. Mortimer Thurlow, sir, the
swell society woman.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know about it,” Nick nodded, sizing Hurst
up more intently. “How long have you been in Professor
Graff’s employ?”</p>

<p>“About a year, sir; ever since he came here.”</p>

<p>“He is not an old resident of Madison, then?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. He came here a year ago next month.”</p>

<p>“Where from?”</p>

<p>“I am not sure, sir, but I think he&mdash;ah, he is coming
right now, sir,” Hurst broke off abruptly. “That’s
his step in the corridor.”</p>

<p>Professor Graff entered at that moment, wearing a
baggy plaid suit, his overcoat and cape, and with a
rusty felt hat on his gray head. His bearded face took
on a look of mild surprise when he saw the detective,<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
who immediately arose, while Tim Hurst explained
glibly:</p>

<p>“This gentleman came with Doctor Devoll to see
you. The doctor has gone down to the laboratory to
telephone to you, thinking&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We’ll go down, Timothy, and save him the trouble,”
Professor Graff interposed blandly, dropping his
coat and cape over a chair. “Will you go with us,
sir, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I think I will,” Nick put in, bent upon keeping the
physician under his eye, and noting that the chemist
did not appear to recall him.</p>

<p>Professor Graff led the way, Nick following, and
Tim Hurst bringing up in the rear. Half a minute
took them down the stairs, through the basement entry,
and into the laboratory.</p>

<p>The detective flashed a swift glance around the
room, at the zinc-covered table, the bottle-laden
shelves, the ground-glass windows, and at a telephone
on one of the walls. But he failed to see the suspected
physician, and he drew back a step, instinctively reaching
for his revolver.</p>

<p>Graff turned at the same moment, however, and
thrust a weapon nearly under the detective’s nose.</p>

<p>“Don’t stir, Carter, foot or finger!” he commanded
sternly. “If you do, you’ll be a dead one on the instant.
I’ll send a bullet through your meddlesome
head.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter was surprised, but not entirely, by the
sudden threatening situation. His eyes were turned,
not upon Graff’s bearded face, but upon his revolver
and the rigid hand that held it&mdash;and upon the slightly
discolored nail of his right thumb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[215]</span></p>

<p>Nick recalled where he last had seen it. His gaze
leaped up to the bearded face. In spite of beard and
wig and slouch hat and padded coat, he now discovered
the wheel within. He was gazing not at the remarkably
artistic disguise, but, through it, at the thin face
and threatening eyes of&mdash;Doctor David Devoll.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE LAST RESORT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Chick was not idle that morning while his chief
was engaged as described. He was not without
equally serious misgivings concerning Patsy Garvan
and the wisdom of Carter’s going alone to interview
Doctor Devoll.</p>

<p>Chick’s anxiety was materially increased, moreover,
when the Wilton House clerk brought him a
letter to the smoking room about an hour after the
chief’s departure, saying inquiringly:</p>

<p>“This may be important, and perhaps you would
care to open it, though it is addressed to Mr. Blaisdell.
It just came in with the first batch of mail.”</p>

<p>Chick took it eagerly and instantly recognized the
hand of Patsy Garvan. He tore it open and read&mdash;the
hurried letter Patsy had dropped in a street box while
trailing Jim Shannon and Toby Monk.</p>

<p>Hurried and brief though it was, it told Chick
enough to instantly start him in search of Toby Monk,
and fortune favored him ten minutes later. He found
the crook jitney driver about to depart with his car,
which he had just finished washing in the stable yard
where Patsy had, indeed, picked up a trail worth following.</p>

<p>Chick sauntered toward him, hands in his pockets,
and glanced at the number plate on the front of the
car. It was wiped as clean as cotton waste and elbow
grease could make it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[217]</span></p>

<p>Toby Monk gazed at him inquiringly, wondering
whether he was to have an unexpected passenger.</p>

<p>“This your car?” Chick questioned, as he came
nearer.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, sure,” Monk nodded.</p>

<p>“That the number of it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. What d’ye think?”</p>

<p>“I think, then, that you are Toby Monk. Am I
right?”</p>

<p>“That’s my name, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Shove your hands in these, then, and be quick
about it,” Chick snapped sharply, jerking out a pair
of open handcuffs. “Don’t get gay or try to bolt or
I’ll bring you down with a bullet. In with them, or
I’ll break your wrists when I lock them.”</p>

<p>Toby’s face had gone as gray as ashes, and he
was trembling from head to foot.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say!” he gasped. “I say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop!” Chick cut in sternly. “We’ve got Devoll,
Shannon, you, and the rest of your thieving gang
where we want you. If you have anything to say, out
with it. What you say now may determine what you’ll
get for last night’s job and a hundred others, including
the murder of Gaston Todd. Come on with it,
if you have anything to say.”</p>

<p>Toby Monk, cornered and thus sternly confronted,
wilted like a drenched rag. The last vestige of color
had left his cowardly face. He gazed wide-eyed at
Chick and asked hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Are you a detective&mdash;one of the Nick Carter
crowd?”</p>

<p>“That’s just who I am.”</p>

<p>“I’ll squeal, then! I’ll squeal,” Toby said hurriedly,<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
taking the last resort of a treacherous coward. “I’ll
blow the whole business, if that will save my skin.
On the level, God hearing me, I did not kill Todd.
I knew nothing about it. I was out with my jitney
when it was done. I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But you know who did it, and why,” snapped
Chick, striking while the iron was hot.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know that,” gasped Toby. “Graff did
it&mdash;Devoll.”</p>

<p>“Both&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Both&mdash;there ain’t any both!” cried Toby. “They
are one and the same, Graff and Devoll. He’s a nut,
a loon, if ever there was one. He’s got the criminal
bee in his bonnet, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wait!” Chick sternly checked him, suppressing
his surprise at the startling disclosure. “Devoll is
back of the whole business, I know, but what started
him into crime?”</p>

<p>“He’s a nut, gone dippy, I tell you,” Toby forcibly
insisted. “Besides, he has doctored the hospital books,
stolen some of the funds, and has turned to crime to
get square.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s it, eh?”</p>

<p>“He began playing two parts a year ago, as a cover
for his jobs, and he rang in three or four of us to
aid him, whacking up part of the plunder with us.
He’s infernally crafty and clever. He poses as Graff
mornings and as Devoll the rest of the time. He lets
only Shannon into his private room in the hospital.
He comes and goes like an evil genius, and that’s just
what he is. He has discovered a narcotic that instantly
dulls the brain and causes sleep till something<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
else is given. He has invented a noiseless revolver
that shoots a globule of poisonous vapor so deadly that
it instantly kills, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s what killed Todd?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He was short in his accounts with his brokers,
but they haven’t discovered it yet. He joined
our gang, hoping to get even, but kicked against robbing
Mrs. Thurlow. He was hoping to marry her
daughter. He threatened to expose Devoll unless he
cut out that job.”</p>

<p>“And Devoll killed him to prevent it?”</p>

<p>“That’s what. He saw Frank Paulding going to
visit a client, and he knew that he and Todd were
rivals. So he thought he could incriminate Paulding
and escape suspicion. He telephoned Todd to come
there and wait in the corridor. Then he watched
from his office till he saw a chance to kill him with his
infernal weapon. He then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Enough of that,” Chick interrupted. “How many
are with you in this gang?”</p>

<p>“Devoll, Shannon, and Tim Hurst.”</p>

<p>“Who is Hurst?”</p>

<p>“He looks after Graff’s office and laboratory in the
Waldmere Chambers.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t Dorson in it, Mrs. Thurlow’s nephew?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but only for last night’s job.”</p>

<p>“I thought so,” snapped Chick. “Where is that
rope of pearls?”</p>

<p>“In Graff’s rooms. Hurst got away with it. He’s
to keep it until&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Until I relieve him of it,” Chick cut in sternly,
dropping the handcuffs into his pocket. “Get into
your car and take me to the Waldmere Chambers.<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
Pick up two policemen on the way. If you attempt
any monkey business, mind you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll not, so help me!” Toby hurriedly protested.
“I’ve thrown up my hands.”</p>

<p>“Get a move on, then. I want Hurst, to begin with,
and that rope of pearls.”</p>

<p>It was not in Chick’s nature to let grass grow under
his feet after having clinched the entire case in this
way. Ten minutes later, leaving Toby Monk in his
car in charge of a policeman, and with two others at
his own heels, he entered Graff’s office in the Waldmere
Chambers. He found it deserted, but upon
quietly opening the side door, he heard voices from
below.</p>

<p>This was about three minutes after Graff held up
Nick Carter with a genuine revolver. Not in the least
dismayed by the situation, though greatly surprised
at detecting Devoll’s double identity, which at once
suggested much that Chick had just learned, the detective
temporarily threw up his hands, saying curtly:</p>

<p>“Well, well, I appear to have walked into a trap.
Don’t be careless with that gun, Professor Graff, or
it might go off. We can discuss this matter without
bloodshed.”</p>

<p>“It will go off all right, Carter, and not miss its
mark, if you venture to show fight,” Devoll retorted,
with suppressed fury beginning to blaze in his evil
eyes. “I warned you of this. I told you what to
expect if you remained in Madison.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re the rat who sent me the anonymous
letter?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and I meant what I said.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[221]</span></p>

<p>“So, I see&mdash;among other things.”</p>

<p>“All, you recognize me, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” Nick sternly interrupted. “I know all
about you now, and of what you are guilty. I know
that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You know too much!” Devoll cut in fiercely. “But
it will do you no good. I have you trapped, as I have
trapped others. I warned you, and you have ignored
the warning. You now shall pay the price. I will
end you with a gas that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That sent Gaston Todd to his death!” snapped
Carter. “I knew it from the first and wanted only the
man.”</p>

<p>“You know too much!” Devoll fiercely repeated.
“Ho, Shannon, come out here! Bring a rope and
bind him from behind. Lend him a hand, Tim, and
be quick about it! I’ll end him as I ended&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>What more the frantic man would have said was
cut short by the heavy tread of many hurrying feet.</p>

<p>Jim Shannon had thrown open the door of a closet,
on the floor of which Patsy Garvan then was lying,
gagged and securely bound, and the burly ruffian, who
had hurried from the hospital after planning with
Devoll this capture of the detective, rushed out with a
rope in each hand, while Tim Hurst darted nearer and
seized Nick from behind.</p>

<p>Mingled with all this, however, was the rush of
other feet, those of Chick and the policemen, together
with the threatening cries of the former, as they rushed
with weapons drawn upon the startled crooks.</p>

<p>But the thunder of one weapon drowned all other
sounds&mdash;again the last resort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[222]</span></p>

<p>Doctor Devoll, with his glaring eyes half starting
from his head, hesitated only for an instant. There
leaped up in his frenzied brain a vision of the electric
chair. With a quick turn of his wrist, he thrust
the revolver into his mouth and pulled the trigger.
Then he pitched forward, hands in the air&mdash;a corpse
when he hit the floor.</p>

<p>There was little to it after that, and but little remains
to be said. Shannon and Hurst were easily
overcome, and soon were lodged with Toby Monk in
the city prison, the first step toward the punishment
they righteously deserved.</p>

<p>Patsy Garvan was speedily liberated, none the worse
for his experience, and only his statements were needed,
if at all, to make a complete and perfect case against
the singular criminal who had ended his evil career
with his own hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thurlow’s rope of pearls was found in a jar in
the laboratory. Nick Carter returned it to her that
afternoon, and told her how and why Dorson had
figured in the theft. Because of his kinship, however,
she refused to prosecute the scamp, and the detective
did not insist upon it.</p>

<p>Nor did Nick Carter go alone to the Thurlow
mansion that afternoon. He took with him the suspected
man who had at his request spent three days
in prison, and by that humiliation aided him to solve
the mystery and secure the guilty.</p>

<p>The gratitude of Edna Thurlow and her mother,
as well as that of Frank Paulding, could not be verbally
described; but it found expression in something
much more substantial than words, and Nick Carter<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
and his assistants returned to New York well repaid
for their fine work in the Madison mystery.</p>

<p class="center p1">THE END.</p>

<p class="p1">No. 1010 of the <span class="smcap">New Magnet Library</span>, entitled
“The Gamblers’ Syndicate,” is another fine story in
which the skill, foresight, daring, and dashing bravery
of Nick Carter and his faithful assistants are employed
in running down a gang of organized crooks.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
